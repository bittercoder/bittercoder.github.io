<p>I'm writing this on a rainy day in August 2012, in Auckland, New Zealand.</p>
<p>My Name is Alex Henderson and I'm a 32 year old software developer, who has been working professionally as a software developer since 1999.</p>
<p><a href="&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2012&#47;08&#47;Headshot2.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-83489633" title="Headshot2" src="&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2012&#47;08&#47;Headshot2-280x300.png" alt="" &#47;><&#47;a></p>
<p>I've had a passion for software development from a very young age - I knew I wanted to write programs for computers since I was 6 years old. My first programs were written on a borrowed Commodore Vic 20, but I really started programming heavily first in <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;GW-BASIC">GW-Basic<&#47;a> and <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;QuickBASIC">Quick Basic<&#47;a> on 286 12mhz clone PC when I was 7 years old.</p>
<p>I learnt C++ when I was 10, but didn't start getting serious about writing software in C++ until age 11 when my family upgrade their computer to a 486 dx 33mhz. During that time I was fascinated with writing 64K Demo's and games in <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Turbo_C%2B%2B">Turbo C++<&#47;a> and in-line assembler, also making use of $5 toll call weekends to dialup to BBS's around New Zealand, shortly before switching to dial-up internet.</p>
<p>I did a "Bachelor of Computing Systems" degree at Unitec from age 17 to 19, and while there was working part time for Schneider Electric. After graduating I got my first full-time development job at <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.terabyte.co.nz&#47;">Terabyte Interactive<&#47;a>, which was based in New Market at the time. While there I worked on ASP code, developing COM components in Visual Basic and working on some C++ projects including a 3D Visualization of a rowing machine. I also spearheaded the introduction of ASP.Net, writing code on the beta releases of C# and ASP.Net.</p>
<p>I eventually took redundancy from that position and next went to work next at Real Developments (also known as Real Sports) which was owned by Lion Breweries - where I stayed for a while working on email marketing solutions.</p>
<p>After leaving Real Development I began working for the North Shore City Council, as the lead developer there committing a lot of my time there on Asset Management solutions (including a product called AMIS), GIS and data warehousing.</p>
<p><a href="&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2012&#47;08&#47;muang_noi_neur_bomb.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-83489638" title="At muang noi - posing by some UXO" src="&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2012&#47;08&#47;muang_noi_neur_bomb-225x300.jpg" alt="" &#47;><&#47;a></p>
<p>After the North Shore City Council <a title="Asia 2005 Post mortem." href="http:&#47;&#47;localhost:8090&#47;wordpress&#47;?p=7926">I took 6 months off and traveled around Asia<&#47;a>, before returning and taking up a position at a startup called "Syzmk" - working on a product which never quite got off the ground, but in concept was similar to technologies such as <a href="http:&#47;&#47;ifttt.com&#47;">IFTTT<&#47;a>.</p>
<p>The start-up eventually imploded in on itself, but the friendship with the founder was not harmed in the process, which I think in retrospect was more important than the success of the idea, and the project was a great opportunity to learn new things.</p>
<p>Finally after spending a 6 years working full time for companies around New Zealand I felt I had gained the experience and contacts necessary to strike out on my own and start my own company - which I did, launching DevDefined Limited in 2007, which has been very successful ever since.</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.devdefined.com">DevDefined Limited<&#47;a> is a boutique consultancy focusing on Product Development and Development Mentoring, which has now been operating for over 6 years. The first product we developed was Screen Architect, a UI prototyping plugin for Enterprise Architect, which was launched in 2007 and won a <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.marketwire.com&#47;press-release&#47;catch-limited-wins-the-jolt-productivity-award-with-screen-architect-962401.htm">Jolt Productivity award in 2009<&#47;a>.</p>
<p>As well as running my own business (with my wife) I work on a number of open source projects periodically including:</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;<a href="https:&#47;&#47;github.com&#47;bittercoder&#47;DevDefined.OAuth">DevDefined.OAuth<&#47;a>, a popular OAuth 1.0 library, which has been incorporated into a number of products since it's introduction including the Xero Client library.<&#47;li>
<li><a href="https:&#47;&#47;github.com&#47;bittercoder&#47;Lob">LOB<&#47;a>, a library for managing the persistence of blobs in NHibernate in a way which allows you to switch the backing store used (i.e. Filesystem, S3, in-database etc.)<&#47;li>
<li>Organising a local developer event called the "<a title="Architecture Chat" href="http:&#47;&#47;localhost:8090&#47;wordpress&#47;?page_id=83489366">Architecture Chat<&#47;a>" - which has had over 150 meetings to date since it was started - it is one of the most successful and long-running community events for .Net developers (though all dev's are welcome) in the Auckland region.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
In the last 3 years I have been focusing a large part of my energies in developing <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.enterprisetester.com">Enterprise Tester<&#47;a>, a test management solution written in .Net and produced by <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.catchsoftware.com">Catch Software<&#47;a>&nbsp;.</p>
<p>Enterprise Tester is the most complex software project I have ever started from scratch - check out my posts on the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;blogs.catchlimited.com">Catch blog<&#47;a> if you are interested in what we are doing! Enterprise Tester <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.marketwire.com&#47;press-release&#47;catch-limited-wins-a-consensus-software-award-with-enterprise-tester-1286080.htm">won a Consensus Software award in 2010<&#47;a>&nbsp;and makes heavy use of many technologies including the DevDefined.OAuth and LOB projects.</p>
<p>In February 2008 I married my wife, who is my business partner in DevDefined Limited and who is also on the Board of Trustees for the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;birdrescue.org.nz&#47;">New Zealand Bird Rescue Charitable Trust<&#47;a>, you can keep track of everything she is up to by reading the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.facebook.com&#47;NZBRCT">NZBRCT facebook page<&#47;a>, or following her updates on twitter <a href="https:&#47;&#47;twitter.com&#47;BirdNerdNews">@birdnerdnews<&#47;a> - she's also an avid amateur photographer posting photos to all the above sites, as well as <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.flickr.com&#47;photos&#47;82277624@N07&#47;">flickr<&#47;a>.</p>

<p>I currently reside in Auckland with my Lovely Wife, 1 cat, 3 budgies and 1 Cockatiel and also own a funky little 100+ year old Villa in Dargaville where I like to spend time over the summer with family, swimming and of course writing code.</p>
