  Unfortunately the old <a href="http:&#47;&#47;discuss.develop.com&#47;advanced-dotnet.html">ADVANCED-DOTNET<&#47;a><br />
  mailing list at <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.develop.com&#47;">DevelopMentor<&#47;a> is being put down,<br />
  like an old but still on the odd occasion faithful dog. This<br />
  would be one of the first .Net mailing lists I ever really<br />
  latched onto (about 6 years ago...) and there have been some<br />
  pretty bright sparks on their since day one.<br />
<&#47;p></p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
Hi all</p>
<p>We are currently undertaking an infrastructure review at DevelopMentor and<br />
have realised that apart from this one list the listserv is not really used<br />
any more. Unfortunately we cannot really justify maintaining the server for<br />
this one list and so we have decided to retire the listserv.</p>
<p>I created this list as a moderated list six and a half years ago and so feel<br />
a bit sad to see its passing, but the world has moved on from mail<br />
reflectors to blogs, web forums and other discussion mediums.</p>
<p>We will be taking the server offline on the 30th September so you have a bit<br />
of time to get anything you need from the archives</p>
<p>Thanks for your involvement over the last few years</p>

  I think what's more disappointing is that in turning it off they<br />
  certainly haven't spent much time thinking about an exit plan,<br />
  because there's no archive availability (the listserv is getting<br />
  turned off completely) or alternative place identified for list<br />
  participants to move to... I often think this is something that<br />
  needs to be thought about up front (and budgeted for,&nbsp;<br />
  almost in some separate trust fund) especially as communities and<br />
  social platforms proliferate - it's a shame to see information<br />
  evaporate.<br &#47;><br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>
  That said it looks like some of the long time readers of the<br />
  group are working to migrate the server away from develop mentor,<br />
  or to move onto <a href="http:&#47;&#47;groups.google.com&#47;group&#47;advanced-dotnet">this google<br />
  group<&#47;a> - be interesting to see where this goes.<br &#47;><br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>
  On a side note I wonder how much sites like <a href="http:&#47;&#47;beta.stackoverflow.com&#47;">stack overflow<&#47;a> will errode<br />
  the last remnants of mail-only technical mailing lists...<br />
  personally (while I've been beta testing it) I've found the stack<br />
  overflow concept doesn't really gel with me - but I can see it's<br />
  appeal to others - personally I prefer discussion over problem<br />
  "resolution" and the ability for a group to collectively choose<br />
  not to answer a problem (because it's but 2 clicks away on a<br />
  simple google search) - where as with the reputation system in<br />
  Stack overflow the simple&#47;dumb&#47;obvious questions are like crack<br />
  for the reputation kidies.&nbsp;<br &#47;><br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>
  On the same note, how much will stack overflow and similar<br />
  concepts errode organic blog discovery (which is normally while<br />
  someone is trying to find an answer to a question).... hmmm<br &#47;><br />
<&#47;p></p>
