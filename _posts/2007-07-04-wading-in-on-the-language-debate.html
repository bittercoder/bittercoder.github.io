  So I see both <a href="http://andrewpeters.net/2007/07/03/73/">Andrew</a>, <a href="http://community.softteq.com/blogs/nick/archive/2007/07/03/languages-only-part-of-the-equation.aspx">Nick</a> and <a href="http://www.base4.net/Blog.aspx?ID=515">Alex<br>
  J</a> have some thoughts on languages, and of course <a href="http://rowansimpson.com/">Rowans</a> post sparked it off... and<br>
  people talk about beautiful languages, mentioning expressiveness<br>
  in the same breath.&nbsp;<br>
</p>
<p>
  Personally I love how expressive Ruby is -&nbsp;I think<br>
  potentially because I got my first exposure to ruby after reading<br>
  <a href="http://poignantguide.net/ruby/">Why's poignant<br>
  guide</a>&nbsp;a while back (I see there are new chapters<br>
  ...oooh) which was quite surreal compared to how I say learnt C++<br>
  (from reading the Borland Turbo C++ manual when I was 11, also my<br>
  first exposure to OOP)...<br>
</p>
<p>
  When I code in ruby I feel like I'm telling stories... I dig that<br>
  :)<br>
</p>
<p>
  So Alex J mentioned that extension methods let us achieve much of<br>
  the syntactic sugar that ruby provides (though obviously in<br>
  ruby's case this isn't so much syntactic sugar as core mechanisms<br>
  in the language itself) - and of course Lambda expressions are<br>
  helping too, but does expressive == good 100% of the<br>
  time?&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't think I'm qualified to say, but I can't<br>
  help but feel that a language which is very expressive, isn't<br>
  necessarily the easiest to manipulate and refactor, so I may not<br>
  be as productive and it may not feel as fluent to me... I quite<br>
  liked this <a href="http://resharper.blogspot.com/2007/07/of-tools-and-languages.html">resharper horizons post</a>&nbsp;which suggests that tooling<br>
  support should probably influence future language design - could<br>
  that requirement possibly fight against an increased level of<br>
  expressiveness in a language, will compromises need to made, or<br>
  is nirvana just around the corner?<br>
</p>As for C# vs VB.Net - large clumsy keywords are only a<br>
probablem until something like Resharper steps in... when I'm<br>
developing I see a lot of unusued space on the right hand side of<br>
the editor with C#... if VB.Net fills it up, and I'm not typing any<br>
harder to get there, why should I care - hell it'll probably make a<br>
VB.Net Resharper Jedi look more impressive then the C# equivalent,<br>
he'll be producing more characters ;o)<br>
<p>
  OK, well I figured this post should at least have some code...<br>
  I'd feel uneasy otherwise... so how about:<br><br>
</p>
<pre>
public static class CommonExtensions{    public static Action<><int>> LoopTo(this int start, int end)    {        return new Action<><int>>(action => To(start, end).ForEach(i => action(i)));    }     public static IEnumerable<int> To(this int start, int end)    {        if (end < start)="" for="" (int="" i="start;" i=""> end - 1; i--)                yield return i;        else            for (int i = start; i < end="" +="" 1;="" i++)="" yield="" return="" i;="" }="" public="" static="" void=""><t>(this IEnumerable<t> sequence, Action<t> action)    {        foreach (T item in sequence) action(item);    }     public static void PrintLine(this object o)    {        Console.WriteLine(o);    }}<br>
</t></t></t></int></int></int></pre>
<p>
  <br><br>
  So now we could try and do this....<br><br>
  <!--<br />
{rtf1ansiansicpglang1024noproof1252uc1 deff0{fonttbl{f0fnilfcharset0fprq1 Courier New;}}{colortbl;??red0green128blue0;red255green255blue255;red0green0blue0;}??fs20 cf1 // rubypar ??cf0 (10..20).each { |i| puts i }par ??cf1 // C#par ??cf0 10.LoopTo(20) (i => i.PrintLine());}<br />
--><br>
</p>
<pre>
// ruby(10..20).each { |i| puts i }// C#10.LoopTo(20) ( i => i.PrintLine() );<br>
</pre>
<p>
  <br><br>
  Alas I don't think C# will ever match ruby in this game, no<br>
  matter how we try to nudge it there... and until the development<br>
  community figures out where the healthy place is to draw the line<br>
  in the attempt, we may be doing more harm then good by pushing<br>
  for it, sacrificing discoverability/maintainability for<br>
  expressiveness.&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe that's just dogma, and<br>
  expressiveness makes code inherently easier to maintain in the<br>
  first place, so we don't need to care.... time will tell.<br><br>
  <br><br>
  Of course I could be wrong, I am&nbsp;a little sleepy ;o)<br>
</p>
