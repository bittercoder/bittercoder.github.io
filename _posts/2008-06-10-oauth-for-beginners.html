<h2>OAuth for Beginners</h2><br>
For those unfamiliar with OAuth, here's a very short&nbsp;run-down... I'm skipping over some of the details but I think this&nbsp;should give you a taste for what it's all about - for a more well rounded introduction, check out this <a href="http://oauth.net/documentation/getting-started">article</a> on the&nbsp;<a href="http://oauth.net/">OAuth.Net</a> website.
<h3>The participants</h3><br>
Consumer - "weitu.googlepages.com" - that application that&nbsp;wants to see protected information the provider has for a&nbsp;user.<br>
Provider - "google.com" - the keeper of a users protected&nbsp;information.<br>
User - a user who stores protected information with the provider&nbsp;(say contacts in gmail)
<h3>The goal</h3><br>
To allow the user to give a consumer access to their data on&nbsp;the provider without the user having to disclose their credentials&nbsp;(username &amp; password) and to allow for fine-grained control&nbsp;over access granted to an individual consumer - i.e. putting power&nbsp;in the hands of the user to revoke access when they want to, and&nbsp;having it only affect one consumer.
<p>A consumer needs to be known to a provider before they can request&nbsp;a token.</p>
<h3>How it works</h3><br>
(For this example we'll use google, for more info on the&nbsp;google implementation see this &nbsp;<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/oauth/browse_thread/thread/75ee6d973930c791">thread</a>)
<p>The provider publishes 3 Urls for their service and documents them&nbsp;on their site somewhere:</p>
<ul>
<li>Request Token Url - <a href="https://www.google.com/accounts/OAuthGetRequestToken">https://www.google.com/accounts/OAuthGetRequestToken</a></li>
<li>User Authorize Url -&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/accounts/accounts/OAuthAuthorizeToken">https://www.google.com/accounts/accounts/OAuthAuthorizeToken</a></li>
<li>Access Token Url - <a href="https://www.google.com/accounts/OAuthGetAccessToken">https://www.google.com/accounts/OAuthGetAccessToken</a></li><br>
</ul><br>
The consumer is known to google by it's consumer key (which in&nbsp;the case of a google api is normally a host address, like&nbsp;www.test.com) and this relationship is established in a proprietary&nbsp;manor (i.e. it's not covered by the OAuth spec).
<h3>Getting a Request Token</h3><br>
The start the ball rolling the consumer makes a request to the&nbsp;Request Token Url, they get back some form-encoded parameters in&nbsp;the body of the response which contains the token&nbsp;information.
<p>As an example, here's an http request to get a new request&nbsp;token:</p>
<div style="border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;">GET /accounts/OAuthGetRequestToken?<br>
scope=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Fm8%2Ffeeds&amp;oauth_nonce=759437c3-3edf-4098-ac14-58d4f162b0e6<br>
&amp;oauth_consumer_key=weitu.googlepages.com<br>
&amp;oauth_signature_method=RSA-SHA1<br>
&amp;oauth_timestamp=1213129078<br>
&amp;oauth_version=1.0<br>
&amp;oauth_token=
<p>&amp;oauth_signature=peUZigwq1BLs%2Bb721vcct2vzA3Odk1j...HTTP/1.1</p>
<p>Host: www.google.com<br>
Connection: Keep-Alive</p>
<p></p></div><br>
And here's the response:
<div style="border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;">HTTP/1.1 200 OK<br>
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8<br>
Date: Tue, 10 Jun 2008 20:18:01 GMT<br>
Expires: Tue, 10 Jun 2008 20:18:01 GMT<br>
Cache-Control: private, max-age=0<br>
Content-Length: 51<br>
Server: GFE/1.3oauth_token=CMiJx-LdFxD56bOXAQ&amp;oauth_token_secret=</div><br>
Notice the oauth_signature and other oauth_ etc. parameters - as&nbsp;part of the OAuth core specification it requires that requests be&nbsp;"signed" so that a provider can ensure they haven't been tampered&nbsp;with - this is one of the aspects my library will take care of for&nbsp;you (signing and verifying requests).
<h3>User Authorization</h3><br>
At that point the consumer now needs to send the user off to&nbsp;the providers site - this involves using the second of the 3 urls,&nbsp;the User Authorize Url... we just append the scope (required by&nbsp;google, identifies the service you wish to access - not part of&nbsp;OAuth spec itself) and the request token (CMiJx-LdFxD56bOXAQ)
<p>Note that the User Authorize Url isn't signed like the other&nbsp;requests... this is because this step may be manual i.e. a user&nbsp;typing or copying a link into their browser or some hand held&nbsp;device.</p>
<div style="border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;">GET /accounts/accounts/OAuthAuthorizeToken?<br>
scope=http://www.google.com/m8/feeds<br>
&amp;oauth_token=CMiJx-LdFxD56bOXAQHTTP/1.1</div><br>
In this case, google takes us to a universal login page:
<p><img src="http://blog.bittercoder.com/images/google_login.jpg" alt="" width="681" height="258" border="1"></p>
<p>Once authenticated it then takes us to a page where we can&nbsp;authorize the consumer to have access:</p>
<p><img src="http://blog.bittercoder.com/images/google_authorize.JPG" alt=""></p>
<p>By granting access at this point the consumer can then use the last&nbsp;of the 3 Urls, the Access Token Url, to exchange their request&nbsp;token for an access token. Upon granting access a few things should&nbsp;happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>An access token should be created.</li>
<li>The access token should be related to the request token.</li>
<li>The currently logged in user should be associated with the&nbsp;access token.</li><br>
</ul><br>
The last point is important - because you're passing tokens&nbsp;around, rather than account names, you need to have the provider&nbsp;implementation record the association between the access token and&nbsp;the user granting access - and it should be easy for your API&nbsp;implementation to fetch the associated user when a protected&nbsp;resource is accessed.
<h3>Exchanging Tokens</h3><br>
Once the user has authorized the consumers access request, the&nbsp;consumer can then exchange their request token for an access token&nbsp;- generally a request token can only be used once - so if the&nbsp;request failed for some reason they would need to start the&nbsp;authorization process again from scratch.
<p>here's the http request for exchanging tokens:</p>
<div style="border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;">GET /accounts/OAuthGetAccessToken?<br>
scope=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Fm8%2Ffeeds<br>
&amp;oauth_token=CMiJx-LdFxD56bOXAQ&amp;oauth_nonce=19fe6f62-8b2c-4a40-b055-210d279ba770<br>
&amp;oauth_consumer_key=weitu.googlepages.com<br>
&amp;oauth_signature_method=RSA-SHA1<br>
&amp;oauth_timestamp=1213129477<br>
&amp;oauth_version=1.0
<p>&amp;oauth_signature=hagokrS1W%2BcBXdRwTIlOd84PSO56OT...&nbsp;HTTP/1.1 Host: www.google.com</p>
<p></p></div><br>
And the corresponding response from the google server:
<div style="border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;">HTTP/1.1 200 OK<br>
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8<br>
Date: Tue, 10 Jun 2008 20:24:39 GMT<br>
Expires: Tue, 10 Jun 2008 20:24:39 GMT<br>
Cache-Control: private, max-age=0<br>
Content-Length: 57<br>
Server: GFE/1.3oauth_token=CNO384n8BRD6pZTT_P____8B&amp;oauth_token_secret=</div><br>
&nbsp;
<h3>Accessing a Protected Resource</h3><br>
Now that the consumer has an access token they can then make&nbsp;requests for protected resources - they just need to use the access&nbsp;token, here's an example of doing just that:
<div style="border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;">GET /m8/feeds/contacts/default/base?<br>
scope=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Fm8%2Ffeeds<br>
&amp;oauth_token=CNO384n8BRD6pZTT_P____8B&amp;oauth_nonce=3ae44855-9d27-4b80-8b4f-2f68d1531657<br>
&amp;oauth_consumer_key=weitu.googlepages.com<br>
&amp;oauth_signature_method=RSA-SHA1<br>
&amp;oauth_timestamp=1213129479<br>
&amp;oauth_version=1.0<br>
&amp;oauth_signature=kTFRbcD1IKzjPADfgF%2B3...HTTP/1.1 Host: www.google.com
<p></p></div><br>
Obviously once the request has been validated (i.e. valid&nbsp;signature, valid token, valid timestamp range, nonce is unique&nbsp;etc.) the provider implementation needs to fetch the user&nbsp;associated with the access token, so it can then return the correct&nbsp;data back to the consumer - normally you would want to&nbsp;automatically associate the token's user with the current request /&nbsp;controller / channel so that OAuth is basically transparent (i.e.&nbsp;it's just like getting a request from a user who's authenticated&nbsp;normally).
<h3>Risks &amp; Issues</h3><br>
One obvious risk is that of phishing... if the consumer sends&nbsp;you to a site that looks like googles authentication page, but&nbsp;isn't google then you're in trouble.&nbsp; Of course this kind of&nbsp;phishing is more a general problem, then something isolated to&nbsp;OAuth.
<p>Another potential risk are that some signature methods are&nbsp;risky/flawed to the <span>consumer</span> due to implementation&nbsp;i.e. if you have a flickr uploader winforms application, and you<br>
use RSA-SHA1, the uploader will need to ship with the x509&nbsp;certificate (including the private key) in their application ...&nbsp;this basically invalidates the strength of that certificate,&nbsp;because anyone could extract and use the private key themselves (so&nbsp;it's as bad as a plain text signature) - on the flip side for a&nbsp;website RSA-SHA1 is very strong because the private key is kept&nbsp;private.</p>
