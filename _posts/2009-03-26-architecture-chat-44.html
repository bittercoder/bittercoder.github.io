    So, what were the comments on the survey? I found it to be very... academic, and not very pragmatic or agile

    Please tell me academia has moved on in the past 15 years since I was at uni....

<p>Average turn out today - with 5 of us showing up, had some&nbsp;interesting discussions though - here's a list of some of the&nbsp;stuff we talked about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Field naming... giving up the habit of underscores, then&nbsp;taking them up again to avoid the additional wordiness of&nbsp;this.whatever, and the practice of avoiding adornments for fields&nbsp;etc. in unit tests to improved the readability/scanability of&nbsp;tests.</li>
<li>Method naming, the move towards more readable/unique names&nbsp;vs. less descriptive heavily overloaded methods, i.e. Find vs.&nbsp;FindByName, FindById etc.</li>
<li>Inner classes used to firewall logic inside a class or hold&nbsp;shared context for a set of operations, the inherit difficulty in&nbsp;testing this, and whether it's a logical refactoring, or a design&nbsp;decision you tend to make up front when writing the outer class.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.sefolklore.com/welcome.html">survey</a> on how&nbsp;relevant computer science teaching is (i.e. how does the&nbsp;curriculum compare with the real world).&nbsp; Being run by Tony&nbsp;Gorschek, Blekinge Institute of Technology, Sweden &amp; Ewan&nbsp;Tempero, Auckland University, New Zealand.</li>
<li>Approaches to testing applications which depend on a large&nbsp;number of small islands of configuration loaded at run time (i.e.&nbsp;xml etc.) which are interdependent - the challenges of validating&nbsp;individual snippets, and issues with snippets potentially relying&nbsp;on other snippets etc.</li>
<li>Redgate taking over reflector.net, and interesting new&nbsp;<a href="http://www.simple-talk.com/community/blogs/bart/archive/2009/03/23/72559.aspx">debugging product</a> coming out as a result.</li>
<li>Rolling your own licensing frameworks, the mixed reaction of&nbsp;being a target for crackers (someone likes me product, but&nbsp;someone doesn't want to pay for it), realities of they'll never&nbsp;pay anyway, common mistakes made when building your own licensing&nbsp;(putting all your license code in a separate assembly, not&nbsp;signing it, not obfuscating) and things like using ILMerge with&nbsp;internals.</li>
<li>Native compilation tools and all-in-one framework bundling&nbsp;tools for .Net (<a href="https://thinstall.com/help/index.php?_netsupport.htm">thinstall</a>,<br />
<a href="http://www.remotesoft.com/">remotesoft salamander</a>,&nbsp;Mono etc.).</li></p>
<li>CouchDB and scalability/query qualities (unfortunately more&nbsp;questions then answer, Peter B &amp; Myself need to have a play&nbsp;with this stuff and report back next time) - interests in&nbsp;insertion costs when you have lots of views, are queries against&nbsp;views really a cheap operation/linear cost.</li>
<li>SEO &amp; Silver light tips and tricks - also discussed&nbsp;hacking browser history in the same was we do with ajax.</li>
<li>Web crawlers pretending to be mobile clients.</li>
<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/">Protocol&nbsp;buffer</a> &amp; .net implementations such as <a href="http://code.google.com/p/protobuf-net/">protobuf-net</a> which&nbsp;you can use with classes marked up with data contracts.</li>
<li>Groking IoC, what are the lights on moments - the difficulty&nbsp;some have with jumping from the principles of DI/IoC to using a&nbsp;container.</li>
<li>Discussed if there might be some value in presenting on&nbsp;practical use of an IoC container at a local user group, as the&nbsp;DI/IoC conversations we've had in Auckland over the last few&nbsp;years tend to stop short of that point, and it's often hard to&nbsp;make the jump from manually doing DI verses using a container to&nbsp;wire everything up and the advantages/disadvantages of doing so.</li><br />
</ul><br />
Thanks to all who came, see you in two weeks.</p>
