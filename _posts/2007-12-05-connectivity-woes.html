<p>Well this blog, the wiki and all the other associated services&nbsp;disappeared for most of today... thanks to the magic of NoAuth ...&nbsp;for no reason that anyone could explain to me beyond "it sometimes&nbsp;happens" - Orcon lost Authority over my business DSL connection,&nbsp;and it reverted back to Telecom&#47;Xtra (New Zealands "legacy"&nbsp;telco)... and it took must of today for them to get the authority&nbsp;changed back, I don't think this was any fault of Orcons, but it&nbsp;still pissed me off no end.</p>
<p>So&nbsp;apologies&nbsp;to anyone wondering where my blog went, or any of the&nbsp;related services - I do have plans to migrate the blog to US&nbsp;servers in the not to distant future.&nbsp; And big&nbsp;apologies&nbsp;to&nbsp;all the Architecture chat participants, sorry I couldn't get a&nbsp;reminder email out sooner.</p>
<p>On a different note - It did identify a need for me to maintain a&nbsp;secondary connection, with a static IP, that I can fall back to if&nbsp;required... thankfully the three concurrent projects that have been&nbsp;in UAT over the last couple of weeks have all wound down now - so&nbsp;it didn't have as much impact as it could of.</p>
<p>Though at least they wouldn't have been able to log bugs about&nbsp;servers being unavailable, Trac would've been unavailable too&nbsp;;o)</p>
<p>... so any suggestions as to what would make an adequate fall back&nbsp;technology (something other then DSL, I've used wired country&nbsp;two-way-radio to the sky tower in the past which has worked well,&nbsp;but it doesn't give much "bang" for buck and has a high up-front&nbsp;cost last time I checked) ... I'm not too worried about 1 day&nbsp;downtime, but if this had been 3 or 4 days it would've been quite&nbsp;damaging for me, customers and those intangibles like&nbsp;reputation.</p>
<p>At any rate - thanks for the patience, and I'll see some of you at&nbsp;the Architecture Chat tomorrow.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>- Alex</p>
