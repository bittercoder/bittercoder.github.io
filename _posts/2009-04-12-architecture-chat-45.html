    Cool, I'll try and set up something this week... which will probably be a metawiki first i.e. a wiki about just what should be in the wiki :P

    To start with I'll use screwturn and throw it up on one of my hosting accounts using something like architecturechat.devdefined.com as the address - but ideally I would like to get a permanent domain name for it, any thoughts suggestions?

    I was thinking if the names a bit more "all-encompassing" then just the Auckland architecture chat we could be an umbrella for other more adhoc conversational dev meetups in Auckland like beer &amp; bytes etc.

    Some quick thoughts for domain names:

    techconversations.net (.com gone)
    devconversations.com /.net
    architecturechat.net (.com gone)
    arcchat.net (.com gone)
    archchat.net.nz / archchat.co.nz / archchat.org.nz
    architecturechat.co.nz / architecturechat.net.nz / architecturechat.org.nz
    techdiscuss.net.nz

    Or perhaps the group needs a better / more interesting name which would warrant a more interesting domain name.

    Hope to see you guys next week.

<p>Smallish turnout - but it was right before the start of a 4 day&nbsp;weekend here in NZ, so hardly surprising.</p>
<p>Topics discussed...</p>
<ul>
<li>Architecture group structure / communication channels /&nbsp;website etc.</li>
<li style="list-style: none; display: inline;">
<ul>
<li>Building a better website for the Architecture Chat (Wiki&nbsp;etc.).</li>
<li>Taxonomy / themes our discussions often take (i.e.&nbsp;Business, Education/Training, Local/Central Government, ORM's&nbsp;&amp; Domain Driven Design, WPF/Silverlight etc.)</li>
<li>Distributing the workload of "write-ups" - by having each&nbsp;discussion topic as a page on the wiki, with each discussion&nbsp;extending that topic - and the ability to continue the&nbsp;discussions outside of the fortnightly meetings.</li>
<li>Possibility of somebody donating some design time to set&nbsp;up the structure for the site.</li>
<li>Group library</li>
<li>Swag / prizes (not sure how this would work just&nbsp;yet).</li><br />
</ul><br />
</li></p>
<li><a href="http://preetsangha.blogspot.com/2009/04/beer-and-bytes-inaugural-meeting.html">Beer &amp; Bytes</a> - Peter went along, and noticed how few&nbsp;people had even tried a "hello world" in WPF or Silverlight,&nbsp;and the difficulty of succinctly defining just what WPF is /&nbsp;it's value proposition in a few short sentences (perhaps this&nbsp;is a good question for stack overflow?).</li>
<li>The generally false opinion (with some anecdotal evidence&nbsp;from Peter) of thinking it's easier to quickly throw a&nbsp;prototype/small UI for an app together in Windows Forms vs. WPF&nbsp;when you're in a hurry, or trying to avoid the additional issues&nbsp;of deploying the 3.5 sp1 framework along with your application.</li>
<li>Commercial controls for WPF vs. Rolling your own, and the&nbsp;general decline the number of commercial controls you need to&nbsp;build an application.</li><br />
</ul><br />
After that the conversation veered off into boatin stories for&nbsp;the remainder of the meeting - so we decided to call it quits and&nbsp;head to lunch.</p>
<p>I look forward to seeing the rest of our regulars back in a&nbsp;fortnight, and hope everyone is having a good Easter break!</p>
