    Cool, I'll try and set up something this week... which will probably be a metawiki first i.e. a wiki about just what should be in the wiki :P

    To start with I'll use screwturn and throw it up on one of my hosting accounts using something like architecturechat.devdefined.com as the address - but ideally I would like to get a permanent domain name for it, any thoughts suggestions?

    I was thinking if the names a bit more "all-encompassing" then just the Auckland architecture chat we could be an umbrella for other more adhoc conversational dev meetups in Auckland like beer &amp; bytes etc.

    Some quick thoughts for domain names:

    techconversations.net (.com gone)
    devconversations.com &#47;.net
    architecturechat.net (.com gone)
    arcchat.net (.com gone)
    archchat.net.nz &#47; archchat.co.nz &#47; archchat.org.nz
    architecturechat.co.nz &#47; architecturechat.net.nz &#47; architecturechat.org.nz
    techdiscuss.net.nz

    Or perhaps the group needs a better &#47; more interesting name which would warrant a more interesting domain name.

    Hope to see you guys next week.

<p>Smallish turnout - but it was right before the start of a 4 day&nbsp;weekend here in NZ, so hardly surprising.</p>
<p>Topics discussed...</p>
<ul>
<li>Architecture group structure &#47; communication channels &#47;&nbsp;website etc.<&#47;li>
<li style="list-style: none; display: inline;">
<ul>
<li>Building a better website for the Architecture Chat (Wiki&nbsp;etc.).<&#47;li>
<li>Taxonomy &#47; themes our discussions often take (i.e.&nbsp;Business, Education&#47;Training, Local&#47;Central Government, ORM's&nbsp;&amp; Domain Driven Design, WPF&#47;Silverlight etc.)<&#47;li>
<li>Distributing the workload of "write-ups" - by having each&nbsp;discussion topic as a page on the wiki, with each discussion&nbsp;extending that topic - and the ability to continue the&nbsp;discussions outside of the fortnightly meetings.<&#47;li>
<li>Possibility of somebody donating some design time to set&nbsp;up the structure for the site.<&#47;li>
<li>Group library<&#47;li>
<li>Swag &#47; prizes (not sure how this would work just&nbsp;yet).<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
<&#47;li></p>
<li><a href="http:&#47;&#47;preetsangha.blogspot.com&#47;2009&#47;04&#47;beer-and-bytes-inaugural-meeting.html">Beer &amp; Bytes<&#47;a> - Peter went along, and noticed how few&nbsp;people had even tried a "hello world" in WPF or Silverlight,&nbsp;and the difficulty of succinctly defining just what WPF is &#47;&nbsp;it's value proposition in a few short sentences (perhaps this&nbsp;is a good question for stack overflow?).<&#47;li>
<li>The generally false opinion (with some anecdotal evidence&nbsp;from Peter) of thinking it's easier to quickly throw a&nbsp;prototype&#47;small UI for an app together in Windows Forms vs. WPF&nbsp;when you're in a hurry, or trying to avoid the additional issues&nbsp;of deploying the 3.5 sp1 framework along with your application.<&#47;li>
<li>Commercial controls for WPF vs. Rolling your own, and the&nbsp;general decline the number of commercial controls you need to&nbsp;build an application.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
After that the conversation veered off into boatin stories for&nbsp;the remainder of the meeting - so we decided to call it quits and&nbsp;head to lunch.</p>
<p>I look forward to seeing the rest of our regulars back in a&nbsp;fortnight, and hope everyone is having a good Easter break!</p>
