    We've talked around this topic a few times - NZ software development firms (and I think, in many cases their attempts at transparent HR policies &amp; staff) struggle to identify categories for developers beyond just a "senior developer" especially as they're not covered by a salary survey - so all they see is a band of pay between $70K and $100K with some "anomalies" in the $120K+ region which are discounted from the survey as being errors (when in fact they're not) - end result being there's just no where for a senior engineer to go but out (of the country that is) to somewhere they might be a little more appreciated financially. In many cases I think being considered a senior developer is the start of your career, not the end (it's like finishing an apprenticeship) - but the pay scale just doesn't reflect that.

    Most of the people that I would say fall more towards distinguished engineer than just joe senior-developer in NZ are contracting&#47;consulting or are at least part owners of the company they work for (a few of them attend the architecture chat ;o).... obviously based on demand you can make a reasonable living from that - but when it comes down to it, you're generally in NZ for family, lifestyle or just because it feels like home.

    What can a small country like NZ do?  Well I think you just need to escape bespoke work - product development, for products&#47;services that appeal to the world stage allow you to get paid in world prices, with the obvious trickle-down effect of paying better money to individual developers involved.  Downside is start-up companies in NZ will struggle to find enough&#47;any VC to make themselves viable without Angel funding.

    Short answer - stick to the US or UK until you need to head back to NZ for babysitters :P

<p>Short writeup for the last architecture chat - we had 7 (or was it&nbsp;8) attending the 11th September 2008 chat - including a couple of&nbsp;intergenites who made the arduous journey over the bridge (always&nbsp;nice to see some new faces!).</p>
<p>Topics of discussion included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Teched 2008 NZ<&#47;li>
<li>Lack of developers in New Zealand, and problems&#47;opportunities&nbsp;with current graduates emerging from various institutes.<&#47;li>
<li>Working for Microsoft, the buy-up of blogging talent.<&#47;li>
<li>The push to improve the profile of bloggers in NZ.<&#47;li>
<li>Bloggers Dinner, Scott Hanselman etc.<&#47;li>
<li>Google chrome.<&#47;li>
<li>PDC 2008.<&#47;li>
<li>Managed Extensibility Framework, what it is&#47;is not - though I&nbsp;don't think of any us are quite sure yet - perhaps Hammet needs&nbsp;to do some videos? ;o)<&#47;li>
<li>Generic Natural Language DSL's and interesting ideas like&nbsp;Intellisense for a Natural Language DSL's (I found this&nbsp;interesting, not sure anyone else did...)<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
It was a bit rambling so by the end of it I think most of us&nbsp;were not really sure just what we'd talked about.</p>
<p>As per usual previous write-ups can be found here on the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;wiki.bittercoder.com&#47;SylviaParkArchitectureChats.ashx">wiki<&#47;a>. &nbsp;There's also a <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.linkedin.com&#47;groups?home=&amp;gid=899297">group on<br />
LinkedIn<&#47;a> for those who have attended in the past (or plan to&nbsp;attend in the future? perhaps) so you can connect with other&nbsp;participants.</p>
<p>The next chat is this Thursday - 25th September - I'll post a&nbsp;reminder tomorrow - and if anyone has any topic suggestions please&nbsp;email or leave a comment on this post.</p>
