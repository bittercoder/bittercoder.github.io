<p>Well I've been really slack of late re: the blog and the coding&nbsp;community in general - but at any rate, what brought me back into&nbsp;focus was actually getting email regarding <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/splicer/">Splicer</a> - yes, there are&nbsp;people using it... who knew?</p>
<p>At any rate, I also noticed that reading back through other&nbsp;peoples blogs - it appears I was actually tagged by <a href="http://www.base4.net/Blog.aspx">Alex James</a> - now I had a&nbsp;personal blog for a while before a technical one, and it's that&nbsp;kind of bollix that drove me away from it as a past time :) but&nbsp;then I'm just a sour sod, soooo....&nbsp;I've decided to respond,&nbsp;if for no&nbsp;other reason but to confirm that I do in fact&nbsp;read&nbsp;<a href="http://www.base4.net/Blog.aspx">Alex James</a>&nbsp;blog&nbsp;- but I wont bother inflicting the pain on anyone else&nbsp;(plus most of the NZ bloggers have already been swatted a few&nbsp;weeks ago)</p>
<p>Without further delay, 5 things you probably don't know about me:</p>
<p>1) I got engaged&nbsp;last year on the rocks at pink beach,&nbsp;omaha.</p>
<p>2) The first programming&nbsp;language I learned was basic for&nbsp;the vic20, followed shortly by gwbasic.&nbsp; And&nbsp;then&nbsp;(turbo) C++ when I was 11 or 12 (I forget exactly).</p>
<p>3) I&nbsp;bought my first car at the end of last year, a BMW&nbsp;318ti.</p>
<p>4) I grew up on a farm and was home schooled for a couple of&nbsp;years, got Dux at the dubious <a href="http://www.nzqa.govt.nz/providers/details.do?providerId=101092001">Rodney college</a> in Wellsford, and then did some tertiary&nbsp;studies (ie. made new friends) at <a href="http://www.unitec.ac.nz/">Unitec</a>.</p>
<p>5) My cat is named <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHODAN">shodan</a>, and my previous&nbsp;cat was run over and consequently body-snatched by gypsies or&nbsp;possibly itallians (according to the neighbours at the time...)</p>
<p>Wasn't that fun, tune in next time when I actually post something&nbsp;of value :)</p>
