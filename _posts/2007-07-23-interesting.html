<p><br &#47;><br />
So IronRuby has been <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.iunknown.com&#47;2007&#47;07&#47;a-first-look-at.html">released<&#47;a> in a pre-alpha state... check out the comments on John Lam's post for some additional details not in the post itself.<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;></p>
<pre>

IronRuby Pre-Alpha (1.0.0.0) on .NET 2.0.50727.312<br />

>>> class RubyAlpha<br />
...     def hello<br />
...            puts "Hello"<br />
...        end<br />
... end<br />
=> nil<br />
>>> r = RubyAlpha.new()<br />

>>> r.hello<br />
Hello<br />

Things of interest:<br &#47;></p>
<ul>
<li>Lots of stuff doesn't work just yet ;o)<br />
  <&#47;li></p>
<li>it will end up on <a href="http:&#47;&#47;rubyforge.org&#47;">Rubyforge<&#47;a>, <span style="text-decoration: underline">not<&#47;span> <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.codeplex.com&#47;">Codeplex<&#47;a>... and I think it's quite an appropriate decision considering the nature of the project... good to see common sense winning over marketing dogma - and it's going to be there by the end of August.<br &#47;><br />
  <&#47;li></p>
<li>The project will eventually be entirely open to community contributions (I don't think that includes the code making up the DLR itself, as a shared platform that's probably something that needs to be tightly controlled)<br &#47;><br />
  <&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;></p>
