<p><br /><br />
So IronRuby has been <a href="http://www.iunknown.com/2007/07/a-first-look-at.html">released</a> in a pre-alpha state... check out the comments on John Lam's post for some additional details not in the post itself.<br /><br />
<br /></p>
<pre>
c:devresourcesIronRuby-Pre-Alpha1BinRelease>rbx.exe<br />
IronRuby Pre-Alpha (1.0.0.0) on .NET 2.0.50727.312<br />

>>> class RubyAlpha<br />
...     def hello<br />
...            puts "Hello"<br />
...        end<br />
... end<br />
=> nil<br />
>>> r = RubyAlpha.new()<br />
=> #<RubyAlpha:0000002b><br />
>>> r.hello<br />
Hello<br />
=> nil<br />

Things of interest:<br /></p>
<ul>
<li>Lots of stuff doesn't work just yet ;o)<br />
  </li></p>
<li>it will end up on <a href="http://rubyforge.org/">Rubyforge</a>, <span style="text-decoration: underline">not</span> <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/">Codeplex</a>... and I think it's quite an appropriate decision considering the nature of the project... good to see common sense winning over marketing dogma - and it's going to be there by the end of August.<br /><br />
  </li></p>
<li>The project will eventually be entirely open to community contributions (I don't think that includes the code making up the DLR itself, as a shared platform that's probably something that needs to be tightly controlled)<br /><br />
  </li><br />
</ul><br /><br />
<br /></p>
