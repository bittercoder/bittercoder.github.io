<p>
  I watched <strong>Immortel</strong>/Immortal last night <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0314063/">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0314063/</a>?which<br>
  was pretty cool, though the character animation is frustrating -<br>
  it features a mix of character animation, CGI of a reasonable<br>
  rate (the scenery is generally of?a very high quality) and a very<br>
  mixed bag of character animation, ranging from models which<br>
  wouldn't look out of place in final fantasy, and others which are<br>
  like watching re-runs of reboot...<br>
</p>
<p>
  I would suggest watching, but depending on your capacity for<br>
  being anal you may either enjoy it or just be left wanting,<br>
  personally I liked it and found the story fun.. though I've<br>
  always liked european science fiction.<br>
