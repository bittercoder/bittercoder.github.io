<p>Well I blew up my feedburner yesterday... my RSS feed was set to&nbsp;max out at 50 items, which, with my love for pasting html-bloated&nbsp;source code was well over the 256K limit.... but feedburner never&nbsp;bothered tell me it was dead... only noticed today... at any<br />
rate, I tried resetting the size to a max of 6 posts in the&nbsp;feed... and pinging it... but it was still dead, so I did a&nbsp;resync... still no joy... In the end I found that I had to turn<br />
off feed burner support in das blog and then resync the&nbsp;feed.</p>
<p>Moral of the story, don't bloat your feed (It was bad form at any&nbsp;rate, especially in bandwidth starved New Zealand ;o)</p>
<p>If you can see this post it's all working again happily...</p>
