<p>Some more pictures for you all, this time we have Laos - only a&nbsp;few as I haven't been taking many:</p>
<p><img title="Laos Kids" src="http://blog.bittercoder.com/content/binary/laos_kids.jpg" alt="Laos Kids" width="480" height="360"></p>
<p>Kids... Laos is all about the people, all the kids are friendly,&nbsp;most of the sales people aren't &nbsp;pushy.. it's pretty good - though&nbsp;poverty is ever present.</p>
<p><img title="Hayley on the slow boat" src="http://blog.bittercoder.com/content/binary/hayley_slow_boat.jpg" alt="Hayley on the slow boat" height="360"></p>
<p>Hayley, the NZ girl from Christchurch I met on the slow boat who&nbsp;I've been hanging out with for the past week.</p>
<p><img title="Laos tractor" src="http://blog.bittercoder.com/content/binary/laos_tractor.jpg" alt="Laos tractor" height="360"></p>
<p>Same Same, But Different - the Laos tractors are like overgrown&nbsp;rotary hoes - nothing &nbsp;here is built as heavily as the Chinese&nbsp;counterpart, though I still smell a soviet influence which was not&nbsp;present in Thailand.</p>
<p><img title="Monks at the waterfall, near Luang Prabang" src="http://blog.bittercoder.com/content/binary/monks_at_waterfall_laos.jpg" alt="Monks at the waterfall, near Luang Prabang" height="480"></p>
<p>The waterfall near Luang Prabang, truely a little piece of&nbsp;paradise.. all the young monks flock here from the local wats at&nbsp;lunchtime to swim for an hour or two - this is only the base of&nbsp;the last waterfall and there are multiple plateaus rising up for&nbsp;200 odd feet above this point.</p>
<p><img title="Bomb Bomb Bomb" src="http://blog.bittercoder.com/content/binary/muang_noi_neur_bomb.jpg" alt="Bomb Bomb Bomb" height="640"></p>
<p>There a bombs in the strangest places here... Laos is all forrest&nbsp;and farmers, it's hard to imagine it's one of the most bombed&nbsp;countries on earth, though it does make you follow the well trod&nbsp;tracks - UXO, unexploded ordinance, is a very real problem here&nbsp;(like Mines in Cambodia).</p>
