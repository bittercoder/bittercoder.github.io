<p>Been doing a little WCF today... I augmented a partial message<br>
class on a client with some additional properties, including<br>
this:<br><br>
<br></p>
<pre>
private bool _partOfResults = true;
<p>public bool PartOfResults<br>
{<br>
    get { return _partOfResults; }<br>
    set { _partOfResults = value; }<br>
}<br>
</p></pre><br><br>
Now I assumed by default the any messages would have<br>
<b>PartOfResults</b> set to <b>true</b>... just like it used to<br>
work with ye olde <b>XmlSerializer</b> ;o)<br><br>
<br><br>
But actually no ... WCF doesn't invoke the constructor - surprised<br>
I hadn't noticed until now - particularly annoying is of course my<br>
unit tests were passing because I was calling the default<br>
constructor on the message... so first of all I decided to cheat<br>
and just implement the method like this:<br><br>
<br>
<pre>
private bool _partOfResults;
<p>public bool PartOfResults<br>
{<br>
    get { return !_partOfResults; }<br>
    set { _partOfResults = !value; }<br>
}<br>
</p></pre><br>
<p>
  But I didn't like the implications ;o) so I went and actually<br>
  looked up how to make it work properly:<br><br>
  <br><br>
</p>
<pre>
[OnDeserialized]<br>
private void InitializeExtraFields(StreamingContext context)<br>
{<br>
    _partOfResults = true;<br>
}<br>
</pre><br><br>
Pretty boring ;o) just surprised me because I haven't done much WCF<br>
since it went final.<br>
