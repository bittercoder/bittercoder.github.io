<p>Evening.&nbsp;&nbsp; Name is Alex Henderson, .Net developer based&nbsp;in Auckland, New Zealand.</p>
<p>In this blog you can expect to find:</p>
<ul>
<li>Information regarding .Net and software development in&nbsp;general.</li>
<li>Information about my own personal software projects.</li>
<li>Probably a little bit of social commentary, to avoid this&nbsp;blog being too dry ;o)</li>
<li>Travel plans, as I get organised for my first holiday&nbsp;overseas.</li><br>
</ul><br>
As a little background, I'm currently just finishing up my last&nbsp;month of work at the North Shore City Council (<a href="http://www.northshorecity.govt.nz/">http://www.northshorecity.govt.nz</a>)&nbsp;where I've spent the last couple of years as a contractor and&nbsp;full time developer, working on a couple of systems there... you&nbsp;might even hear a little about some of experiences I've had with&nbsp;these, as and&nbsp;when I feel like it...
