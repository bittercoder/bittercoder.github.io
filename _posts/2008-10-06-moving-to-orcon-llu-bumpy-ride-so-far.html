  content: After googling it seems like a lot of people on various ISP's in NZ are
    struggling with LLU - especially with ADSL2+ hardware and certain modem vendors
    i.e. Linksys. I can only hope they sort it out soon as well!

<p>As some may have noticed, this blog has been up and down like a<br />
yo-yo for the last two weeks.<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
The issues are caused by the fact that I host it off the home<br />
office connection - which by and large has been solid as a rock for<br />
the last 2 years, considering the amount of traffic the site gets<br />
is fairly minimal.<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
I opted to be one of the first guinea pigs to try the LLU (Local<br />
Loop Unbundled) offering from <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.orcon.net.nz&#47;">Orcon<&#47;a> on the home office - alas it<br />
has not been a pain-free experience.&nbsp; I think google analytics<br />
tells the story best:<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
<img src="http:&#47;&#47;blog.bittercoder.com&#47;images&#47;LLU_Problems.PNG" altsrc="LLU_Problems.PNG" border="0" height="228" width="575" &#47;><br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
The connection got switched to LLU on around the 21st &#47; 22nd of<br />
September - at which point my connection became a bit erratic -<br />
then it started working well enough - before going wonky again, and<br />
then completely falling over altogether on the following Saturday -<br />
at that point there was no sync.<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
Around Wednesday sync was restored, then Auth as well on thursday<br />
(so 5 days without any access) - the connection was looking ok at<br />
that point, but then a day or so later I started noticing that it<br />
was disconnecting every 5 to 10 minutes, then taking another 20 or<br />
so seconds to re-establish the connection, that's still happening<br />
as we speak - though they helpdesk has now raised the priority of<br />
the ticket to urgent in the hope that it might be resolved<br />
soon.<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
So far I've been a pretty disappointed with the alacrity of Orcons<br />
resolution process and the lack of direct contact that can be made<br />
with the LLU team.&nbsp; Normally with Orcon issues get logged with<br />
the help desk, a ticket is raised, and after a couple of days you<br />
end up dealing directly with corporate support (i.e. people who<br />
know what's wrong) - this process works well, and seems to filter<br />
out those people who actually have problems related to their own<br />
hardware or lack of knowledge.<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
Not so with LLU, you raise a ticket, but the LLU team can't be<br />
contacted directly, and as happened with me - I had no connectivity<br />
for 5 days, and also nothing done about the issue, it just sat in<br />
the queue - and the helpdesk did not seem to know any more about<br />
the issue then I did - I end up feeling bad having to pester the<br />
helpdesk every day to find out the progress on the issue - and they<br />
keep feeding me the same line of "the LLU tech will call you once<br />
the issue has started being worked on &#47; resolved, I'm sure they'll<br />
do a card reset 1am tomorrow" - So far nobody from Orcon has ever<br />
called me (and I'm not actually sure they ever did do a card reset,<br />
but I suspect that's probably not the issue either).<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
Now I'm not blogging this out of Venom - I mean all said 'n done I<br />
am guinea pigging the service to some extent and I know if I'd just<br />
stuck with my previous telecom&#47;Orcon mix none of this would have<br />
happened - and the @Orcon folks on twitter have offered to help<br />
push the ticket through quicker which was nice (incidentally ISP<br />
available on twitter == good) - but still I just hope the issue<br />
resolution process becomes a little more robust, and I thought this<br />
might be interesting to anyone else out there considering jumping<br />
on the LLU band wagon.<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
So my peeves so far are:<br &#47;></p>
<ol>
<li>Orcon don't actually seem to be doing any follow-up - I had<br />
  to do all the calling (and sitting in the queue) incidentally,<br />
  3pm is the perfect time to call their helpdesk, it's never<br />
  busy.<br &#47;><br />
  <&#47;li></p>
<li>The LLU team can't be contacted - that bugs me - pestering<br />
  the help desk is counter-productive for days on end, when the<br />
  issue is sitting with the LLU team.&nbsp; Being able to check the<br />
  ticket status (with notes etc.) on-line would be have been nice<br />
  as well (and saved some phone calls).<br &#47;><br />
  <&#47;li></p>
<li>The helpdesk doesn't seem to even know when the LLU team will<br />
  look at an issue.&nbsp; I got the distinct feeling the help desk<br />
  guys knew as little as I did.<br &#47;><br />
  <&#47;li></p>
<li>No weekend support - I lost connectivity early Saturday, but<br />
  the LLU team doesn't work on the weekend (or so the helpdesk told<br />
  me) - this sucks - telecom have engineers working weekends,<br />
  especially as Orcon are responsible for phone issues as well, I<br />
  could end up with no internet or voice for an entire weekend -<br />
  something I've always found Telecom very quick to respond<br />
  to.&nbsp; I would hope this only applies to home customers!<br &#47;><br />
    <&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ol>Hopefully these (and the technical issues I'm having) are all<br />
just teething problems and will go away as the LLU roll out<br />
continues - in the mean time forgive this blog for being partially<br />
unavailable, and my apathy in not bothering to move the site to<br />
dedicated hosting (which I do plan to do sometime this year,<br />
probably along with a change in blogging software - but I'm too<br />
busy with other things at the moment).<br &#47;></p>
