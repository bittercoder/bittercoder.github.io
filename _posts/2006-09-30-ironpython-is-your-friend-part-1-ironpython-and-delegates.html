<p>
  I felt like posting some code snippets... so I was looking around<br>
  and thought perhaps some IronPython might be interesting.... Some<br>
  of you may find this useful, possibly not.&nbsp; I tend to<br>
  explore functionality using unit tests, so all my code will be<br>
  test cases - I might make this part of a small series on looking<br>
  at python code with a view to integrating it into an existing<br>
  system as a scripting engine.&nbsp; Lets call the series<br>
  "IronPython is your friend"... because it really is.<br><br>
  <br><br>
</p>
<h1>
  Part 1 - IronPython and delegates....<br>
</h1>So you have downloaded the IronPython runtime dll's, and you<br>
would like to start integrating it into some project your working<br>
on... first off lets create a python engine, and make sure it<br>
goes....<br><br>
<br>
<pre>
[Test]<br>
public void GetGoing()<br>
{<br>
    PythonEngine engine = new PythonEngine();<br>
    engine.Execute("myString = 'hello'");<br>
    Assert.AreEqual("hello reader", engine.Evaluate("myString + ' reader'"));<br>
}<br>
</pre><br><br>
That was pretty easy; we executed some python code to assign the<br>
value hello to myString, and then evaluated the expression - sweet<br>
you might say - no effort required.<br><br>
<br><br>
Now, you could write your scripting engine so that it passed the<br>
strings to the engine for evaluation every time you wanted to<br>
evaluate them - but this strings malarkey isn't very pleasant...<br>
what we really want is a decent god fearing .Net delegate, so we<br>
can call this without having to think about the python engine....<br>
Lets check out our first destination, method delegates.<br><br>
<br>
<h2>
  Method Delegates<br>
</h2>Given a converter delegate like this:<br><br>
<br><br>
<span style="color: teal;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
Converter</span><span style="color: blue;">int</span>,<br>
<span style="color: blue;">string</span>><br><br>
<br><br>
(Which by the way, if you haven't stumbled across the generic<br>
<b>Converter</b><i>TInput</i>,<i>TOutput</i>> delegate yet,<br>
effectively you end up with a delegate method of the<br>
definition"<i>TOutput</i> <b>Converter</b>(<i>TInput</i>)" - pretty<br>
handy actually)<br><br>
&nbsp;<br><br>
We could do this:<br><br>
<br>
<pre>
[Test]<br>
public void StatementsToStronglyTypedDelegate()<br>
{<br>
    PythonEngine engine = new PythonEngine();<br>
    List<string> parameters = new List<string>(new string[] {"age"});<br>
    Converter<int, string=""> converter =<br>
        engine.CreateMethod<><int, string="">>("return str(age+1)", parameters);<br>
    Assert.AreEqual("11", converter(10));<br>
}<br>
</int,></int,></string></string></pre><br><br>
Using a strongly typed overload for the engine's<br>
<b>CreateMethod</b> method, we're able to evaluate statements using<br>
our new delegate, which in turn uses our IronPython method we<br>
created earlier... looks promising!<br><br>
<br>
<h2 style="font-weight: bold">Events<br>
</h2>Now delegates are cool,&nbsp; but it's only half the story for<br>
scripting in an application - depending on your model, you may be<br>
aiming to produce results similar to a microsoft's VBA in<br>
applications like Excel or Word - and for this we need to be able<br>
to assign python code to events on our own classes... we can do<br>
this using delegates of course, or we could let the python (user<br>
code) do this itself, and save some time.... So lets have a look at<br>
the latter:<br><br>
<br>
<pre>
[Test]<br>
public void HookingToEvents()<br>
{<br>
    PythonEngine engine = new PythonEngine();
<p>    ManualResetEvent waitHandle = new ManualResetEvent(false);<br>
    WebClient client = new WebClient();</p>
<p>    List<string> results = new List<string>();</string></string></p>
<p>    engine.Globals["client"] = client;<br>
    engine.Globals["results"] = results;</p>
<p>    engine.Execute(<br>
        @"def storeResult(sender, e):<br>
    results.Add(e.Result)<br>
    e.UserState.Set()</p>
<p># assign out storeResult function as an event handler for the client class<br>
client.DownloadStringCompleted += storeResult<br>
");</p>
<p>    client.DownloadStringAsync(<br>
        new Uri(<br>
            "http://api.feedburner.com/awareness/1.0/GetFeedData?uri=http://feeds.feedburner.com/BitterCoder"),<br>
        waitHandle);</p>
<p>    Assert.IsTrue(waitHandle.WaitOne(10000, false), "timeout occured after 10 seconds");</p>
<p>    Assert.AreEqual(1, results.Count);</p>
<p>    Assert.IsTrue(results[0].StartsWith("<><br>
}<br>
</p></pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>
This test is a bit clunky, but you get the idea... we are:<br>
<ul>
<li>Creating a web client, for downloading some xml from a web<br>
  site.<br>
  </li>
<li>Set the client as a global variable for the default module in<br>
  the python engine.<br>
  </li>
<li>Execute some python, which creates a function, and assigns<br>
  that function as a handle for the web client's<br>
  DownloadStringCompleted event (take note at how concise the code<br>
  is, this would be a lot uglier in C#)<br><br>
  </li>
<li>start the async download<br>
  </li>
<li>Make sure we got a response, and that the python code did<br>
  what it should.<br>
  </li><br>
</ul>All in all, with a little finesse you can recreate a model<br>
similar to VBA, driving your extension points from events - and<br>
this certainly has some merit - obviously you want to create the<br>
code in their own modules, as opposed to using the default module<br>
for the python engine as we are.<br><br>
<br><br>
We haven't quite finished with delegates yet though, I'll leave<br>
that for part 2 - which I'll post shortly.<br><br>
