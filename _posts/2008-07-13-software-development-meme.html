<p>Looks like I've been <a href="http:&#47;&#47;blogs.msdn.com&#47;alexj&#47;archive&#47;2008&#47;07&#47;09&#47;software-development-meme.aspx"><br />
tagged<&#47;a> <a href="http:&#47;&#47;flanders.co.nz&#47;2008&#47;07&#47;12&#47;how-i-got-started-in-software-development&#47;"><br />
twice<&#47;a> - so here goes.<br &#47;></p>
<h2>
  How old were you when you first started programming?<br />
<&#47;h2>Apple II e when I was like 7, Vic20 when I was like 8... but<br />
really my start was about 10 with GW-Basic on a 286 AT 16mhz.<br &#47;></p>
<h2>
  How did you get started in programming?<br />
<&#47;h2>I was interested in programming from about age 6 or 7.. though<br />
I think I was 12 when I taught myselfTurbo C++ (And the object<br />
oriented concepts that went with it) - so I've spent over half my<br />
life in object oriented languages - not sure if that's good or<br />
bad!&nbsp;<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
I owe my parents a large amount of gratitude as they recognized my<br />
interests early on, and though we had little money they spent a lot<br />
trying to encourage my interests (computers were not so cheap in<br />
the 80's).<br &#47;></p>
<h2>
  What was your first language?<br />
<&#47;h2>Basic on the Apple II e and Vic20 - but really I think it<br />
wasn't until GW-Basic in Dos4 (and later quick basic) that I became<br />
fluent at writing programs and starting to break problems out into<br />
a series of functions. After basic came C++ (and in-line<br />
assembler), Tcl&#47;Tk and Visual Basic 3 or 4 - then once I started<br />
tertiary study I added Pascal, Delphi, Jade, bash, java and perl to<br />
the list.<br &#47;></p>
<h2>
  What was the first real program you wrote?<br />
<&#47;h2>A "real" program ... I'm going to take "real" as something<br />
commercial with "users" ... hmm.. I had a part-time job when I was<br />
like 14 helping to add functionality to a C based DOS accounting<br />
system used around New Zealand - That'd be the first "real" program<br />
I added code to.&nbsp; Around 17 I started writing a lot of code<br />
for open source projects [same time I started studying at Unitec]<br />
(I think all the projects are dead and gone now) and had a keen<br />
interest in writing libraries for game development prior to the<br />
advent of hardware accelerated 3D, later transferring that interest<br />
to OpenGL once Voodoo and NVidia hardware started getting<br />
cheaper.<br &#47;></p>
<h2>
  What languages have you used since you started programming?<br />
<&#47;h2>Basic (at least 4 or 5 variants), C, C++, Tcl&#47;tk, Bash,<br />
Pascal, Jade, Java, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, ASP, T-SQL, Visual<br />
Basic 3 and above, VB.Net, F#, VBA, Lisp, Perl, Boo and a few<br />
others - though C# has been my language of choice since the early<br />
beta's of the .Net Framework v1.<br &#47;></p>
<h2>
  What was your first professional programming gig?<br />
<&#47;h2>I think probably working as a Junior at <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.terabyte.co.nz&#47;">Terabyte<&#47;a> Interactive (when they<br />
were based in Newmarket) on a rowing machine C++&#47;OpenGl<br />
visualization app (the infamous RowPro project).<br &#47;></p>
<h2>
  If you knew then what you know now, would you have started<br />
  programming?<br />
<&#47;h2>Without a doubt - I was passionate about it when I was 8...<br />
I'm still passionate about it after 20 years. It scratches 2 itches<br />
I've had my entire life, a need to create and a need to<br />
debate&#47;discuss&#47;analyze problems&#47;challenges.<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
If there is one thing you learned along the way that you would tell<br />
new developers, what would it be?<br &#47;><br />
Learn to learn, and if you don't like learning find a new<br />
profession.&nbsp; I almost feel like learning is my job, and<br />
developing solutions is a side-effect of trying to achieve my<br />
primary objective of learning.<br &#47;></p>
<h2>
  What's the most fun you've ever had ... programming?<br />
<&#47;h2>Hmm... I couldn't pick any one project - most fun<br />
environment-wise would be my early days a Terabyte, it had a<br />
wonderful dot-com feel, and we didn't have much work on (at times),<br />
so we got to pursue our own pet projects and take long team<br />
breakfasts in the local cafe - A fun environment, albeit a doomed<br />
one.<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
Probably since then I would say the "Syzmk Rich Media Processor" -<br />
an application which had a wonderful variety of requirements and an<br />
interesting suite of technologies (it was developed with early<br />
releases of the Castle project and betas of the .Net Framework 2.0)<br />
and was one of the first projects I approached in a TDD<br />
fashion.<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;></p>
