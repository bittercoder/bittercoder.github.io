<p>Looks like I've been <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/alexj/archive/2008/07/09/software-development-meme.aspx"><br>
tagged</a> <a href="http://flanders.co.nz/2008/07/12/how-i-got-started-in-software-development/"><br>
twice</a> - so here goes.<br></p>
<h2>
  How old were you when you first started programming?<br>
</h2>Apple II e when I was like 7, Vic20 when I was like 8... but<br>
really my start was about 10 with GW-Basic on a 286 AT 16mhz.<br>
<h2>
  How did you get started in programming?<br>
</h2>I was interested in programming from about age 6 or 7.. though<br>
I think I was 12 when I taught myselfTurbo C++ (And the object<br>
oriented concepts that went with it) - so I've spent over half my<br>
life in object oriented languages - not sure if that's good or<br>
bad!&nbsp;<br><br>
<br><br>
I owe my parents a large amount of gratitude as they recognized my<br>
interests early on, and though we had little money they spent a lot<br>
trying to encourage my interests (computers were not so cheap in<br>
the 80's).<br>
<h2>
  What was your first language?<br>
</h2>Basic on the Apple II e and Vic20 - but really I think it<br>
wasn't until GW-Basic in Dos4 (and later quick basic) that I became<br>
fluent at writing programs and starting to break problems out into<br>
a series of functions. After basic came C++ (and in-line<br>
assembler), Tcl/Tk and Visual Basic 3 or 4 - then once I started<br>
tertiary study I added Pascal, Delphi, Jade, bash, java and perl to<br>
the list.<br>
<h2>
  What was the first real program you wrote?<br>
</h2>A "real" program ... I'm going to take "real" as something<br>
commercial with "users" ... hmm.. I had a part-time job when I was<br>
like 14 helping to add functionality to a C based DOS accounting<br>
system used around New Zealand - That'd be the first "real" program<br>
I added code to.&nbsp; Around 17 I started writing a lot of code<br>
for open source projects [same time I started studying at Unitec]<br>
(I think all the projects are dead and gone now) and had a keen<br>
interest in writing libraries for game development prior to the<br>
advent of hardware accelerated 3D, later transferring that interest<br>
to OpenGL once Voodoo and NVidia hardware started getting<br>
cheaper.<br>
<h2>
  What languages have you used since you started programming?<br>
</h2>Basic (at least 4 or 5 variants), C, C++, Tcl/tk, Bash,<br>
Pascal, Jade, Java, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, ASP, T-SQL, Visual<br>
Basic 3 and above, VB.Net, F#, VBA, Lisp, Perl, Boo and a few<br>
others - though C# has been my language of choice since the early<br>
beta's of the .Net Framework v1.<br>
<h2>
  What was your first professional programming gig?<br>
</h2>I think probably working as a Junior at <a href="http://www.terabyte.co.nz/">Terabyte</a> Interactive (when they<br>
were based in Newmarket) on a rowing machine C++/OpenGl<br>
visualization app (the infamous RowPro project).<br>
<h2>
  If you knew then what you know now, would you have started<br>
  programming?<br>
</h2>Without a doubt - I was passionate about it when I was 8...<br>
I'm still passionate about it after 20 years. It scratches 2 itches<br>
I've had my entire life, a need to create and a need to<br>
debate/discuss/analyze problems/challenges.<br><br>
<br><br>
If there is one thing you learned along the way that you would tell<br>
new developers, what would it be?<br><br>
Learn to learn, and if you don't like learning find a new<br>
profession.&nbsp; I almost feel like learning is my job, and<br>
developing solutions is a side-effect of trying to achieve my<br>
primary objective of learning.<br>
<h2>
  What's the most fun you've ever had ... programming?<br>
</h2>Hmm... I couldn't pick any one project - most fun<br>
environment-wise would be my early days a Terabyte, it had a<br>
wonderful dot-com feel, and we didn't have much work on (at times),<br>
so we got to pursue our own pet projects and take long team<br>
breakfasts in the local cafe - A fun environment, albeit a doomed<br>
one.<br><br>
<br><br>
Probably since then I would say the "Syzmk Rich Media Processor" -<br>
an application which had a wonderful variety of requirements and an<br>
interesting suite of technologies (it was developed with early<br>
releases of the Castle project and betas of the .Net Framework 2.0)<br>
and was one of the first projects I approached in a TDD<br>
fashion.<br><br>
