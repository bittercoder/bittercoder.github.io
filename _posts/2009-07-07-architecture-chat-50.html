<p>Sorry for the delays, here's the write-up for the last architecture&nbsp;chat.</p>
<ul>
<li>Discussed equivalent Java <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_%28file_format%29">WAR&nbsp;Files</a>, and options/alternatives (or lack there of) for .Net -&nbsp;including Sharepoint's WSP files, and the Microsoft web platform&nbsp;installer.</li>
<li>Internationalisation - discussions around the lack of good,&nbsp;free tools for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization">i18n'ing</a> applications and user interfaces easily.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/03/crunchpad-the-launch-prototype/">Crunchpad device</a>, and a brief side-conversation about&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Arrington">Mike&nbsp;Arringtons</a> antics in the geek media lately.</li>
<li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.compilation.buildprovider.aspx">Build Providers</a>, and their uses.</li>
<li>Refactoring legacy code as a skill and discussions around&nbsp;painting inwards from many corners and other apporaches to&nbsp;dividing, conquering and controlling legacy code.</li>
<li>Vodafone MM7 gateway on the way.</li>
<li>Outsourcing / Telecommuting, and general factors such as Time&nbsp;zones, synchronizing streams of works, the productivity bonuses&nbsp;and personality challenges of working away from your team.</li>
<li>Ipod touch as a handheld device to target for business app&nbsp;development.</li>
<li>Conditional defines, modularity and the roll on effects for&nbsp;continuous integration and support.</li>
<li>Mono's difficulties/bad PR on Linux as people get&nbsp;confused/concerned about licensing.</li>
<li>Memory mapped files in .Net 4.0 (easier to use that you'd&nbsp;expect).</li>
<li>Was ruby the right choice - discussing thoughtworks&nbsp;experiences with ruby, the velocity at which new tools are&nbsp;developed/adopted/dropped for the ruby platform, and what&nbsp;paralells and differences exist between it and .Net.</li><br>
</ul><br>
We also had a new comer, who's just moved back to Auckland&nbsp;from overseas, <a href="http://twitter.com/josh_robb">Josh<br>
Robb</a>.&nbsp; Always glad to see new faces!
