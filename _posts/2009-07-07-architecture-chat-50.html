<p>Sorry for the delays, here's the write-up for the last architecture&nbsp;chat.</p>
<ul>
<li>Discussed equivalent Java <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;War_%28file_format%29">WAR&nbsp;Files<&#47;a>, and options&#47;alternatives (or lack there of) for .Net -&nbsp;including Sharepoint's WSP files, and the Microsoft web platform&nbsp;installer.<&#47;li>
<li>Internationalisation - discussions around the lack of good,&nbsp;free tools for <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Internationalization_and_localization">i18n'ing<&#47;a> applications and user interfaces easily.<&#47;li>
<li><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.techcrunch.com&#47;2009&#47;06&#47;03&#47;crunchpad-the-launch-prototype&#47;">Crunchpad device<&#47;a>, and a brief side-conversation about&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Michael_Arrington">Mike&nbsp;Arringtons<&#47;a> antics in the geek media lately.<&#47;li>
<li><a href="http:&#47;&#47;msdn.microsoft.com&#47;en-us&#47;library&#47;system.web.compilation.buildprovider.aspx">Build Providers<&#47;a>, and their uses.<&#47;li>
<li>Refactoring legacy code as a skill and discussions around&nbsp;painting inwards from many corners and other apporaches to&nbsp;dividing, conquering and controlling legacy code.<&#47;li>
<li>Vodafone MM7 gateway on the way.<&#47;li>
<li>Outsourcing &#47; Telecommuting, and general factors such as Time&nbsp;zones, synchronizing streams of works, the productivity bonuses&nbsp;and personality challenges of working away from your team.<&#47;li>
<li>Ipod touch as a handheld device to target for business app&nbsp;development.<&#47;li>
<li>Conditional defines, modularity and the roll on effects for&nbsp;continuous integration and support.<&#47;li>
<li>Mono's difficulties&#47;bad PR on Linux as people get&nbsp;confused&#47;concerned about licensing.<&#47;li>
<li>Memory mapped files in .Net 4.0 (easier to use that you'd&nbsp;expect).<&#47;li>
<li>Was ruby the right choice - discussing thoughtworks&nbsp;experiences with ruby, the velocity at which new tools are&nbsp;developed&#47;adopted&#47;dropped for the ruby platform, and what&nbsp;paralells and differences exist between it and .Net.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
We also had a new comer, who's just moved back to Auckland&nbsp;from overseas, <a href="http:&#47;&#47;twitter.com&#47;josh_robb">Josh<br />
Robb<&#47;a>.&nbsp; Always glad to see new faces!</p>
