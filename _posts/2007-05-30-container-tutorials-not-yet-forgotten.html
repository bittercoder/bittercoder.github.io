<p>I've been getting a few questions about different aspects of the container tutorials series I posted a while back - while the series is not finished, neither is it forgotten, I've collated information regarding the series into a <a href="http://wiki.bittercoder.com/ContainerTutorials.ashx">topic on my wiki</a> and I'll keep this up to date until I've finished the series off.</p>
<p>I also notice Sam Gentile has posted that he's <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/sam.gentile/archive/2007/05/29/castle microkernel-windsor-resources.aspx"> taking the plunge</a> into learning about castle's Windsor container... good to hear :)</p>
