  content: "Hi LebStar,\n\nI'll post more about this tomorrow when I have time - but
    here's the code I use for establishing which columns should be displayed at all:\n\nprivate
    static bool IsHidden(SPField field)\n{\n    return (field.Hidden || field.ReadOnlyField
    || field.Type == SPFieldType.Attachments);\n}\n\n\nforeach (SPField field in list.Fields)\n{\n
    \   if (!IsHidden(field))\n    {\n        if (!field.ShowInNewForm.HasValue ||
    field.ShowInNewForm.Value)\n        {\n\t\t&#47;&#47; include this field on the
    new form\n        }\n        if (!field.ShowInEditForm.HasValue || field.ShowInEditForm.Value)\n
    \       {\n\t\t&#47;&#47; include this field on the edit form\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nWhen
    I get a little more time I'll post some more code about how I had this web part
    auto-generate a default column configuration file for new&#47;edit modes which
    could then be edited to change the order&#47;visibile&#47;editability etc. It's
    pretty trivial though.\n\nCheers, \n\n - Alex"

  Here are some more SharePoint hacks (continuing on from my last<br />
  post <a href="http:&#47;&#47;blog.bittercoder.com&#47;PermaLink,guid,d9d2ba93-08b4-4495-866e-6a6d9241c02d.aspx">here<&#47;a>)<br &#47;><br />
  <br &#47;><br />
  First off some hacks for the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;blogs.msdn.com&#47;powlo&#47;archive&#47;2007&#47;02&#47;25&#47;displaying-custom-data-through-sharepoint-lists-using-spgridview-and-spmenufield.aspx">SPGridView<&#47;a> which is actually a pretty useful control, but<br />
  fails to do a few things, like displaying attachment columns<br />
  as-per SharePoint's default List views (with a little paper-clip<br />
  symbol), and the second (and much more annoying) it doesn't use<br />
  the current users regional settings &#47; timezone for formatting<br />
  DateTime values.<br &#47;><br />
  <br &#47;><br />
  The hacks:<br &#47;><br />
<&#47;p></p>
<ul>
<li>
    <a href="http:&#47;&#47;wiki.bittercoder.com&#47;AttachmentColumnInSPGridView.ashx">Attachments bound field<&#47;a><br />
  <&#47;li></p>
<li>
    <a href="http:&#47;&#47;wiki.bittercoder.com&#47;DatesNotWorkingWithDSTInSPGridView.ashx">Localized DateFime bound field<&#47;a><br />
  <&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul>And finally support for a ListForm replacement web part -<br />
after trying to customize the ListForm to suit a customers<br />
requirements by creating a CustomListForm in SharePoint designer I<br />
gave up in disgust because it's just too limited in what it lets<br />
you achieve, and worst of all, it breaks attachments support!&nbsp;<br />
So I wrote a small web part to replace it, which allows for<br />
fine-grained control of visibility and editability (if that's even<br />
a word) of each field, and as an added bonus it doesn't break the<br />
attachments functionality.&nbsp; I also wanted to add additional<br />
links&#47;buttons to the form which triggered a save including<br />
validation etc. - so I did a little hack to implement that as<br />
well.<br &#47;></p>
<ul>
<li>
    <a href="http:&#47;&#47;wiki.bittercoder.com&#47;WebPartToReplaceNewOrEditForm.ashx">Web part to replace New or Edit ListForm<&#47;a><br />
  <&#47;li></p>
<li>
    <a href="http:&#47;&#47;wiki.bittercoder.com&#47;AddLinksToEditFormWebPart.ashx">Adding<br />
    links to the Edit Form web part<&#47;a><br &#47;><br />
  <&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul>I might have a few more to post before the end of the project<br />
- but it's almost wrapped up, so these may be the last for a<br />
while.<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
Hopefully someone out there finds them useful.<br &#47;></p>
