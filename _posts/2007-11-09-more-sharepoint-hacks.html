  content: "Hi LebStar,\n\nI'll post more about this tomorrow when I have time - but
    here's the code I use for establishing which columns should be displayed at all:\n\nprivate
    static bool IsHidden(SPField field)\n{\n    return (field.Hidden || field.ReadOnlyField
    || field.Type == SPFieldType.Attachments);\n}\n\n\nforeach (SPField field in list.Fields)\n{\n
    \   if (!IsHidden(field))\n    {\n        if (!field.ShowInNewForm.HasValue ||
    field.ShowInNewForm.Value)\n        {\n\t\t// include this field on the
    new form\n        }\n        if (!field.ShowInEditForm.HasValue || field.ShowInEditForm.Value)\n
    \       {\n\t\t// include this field on the edit form\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nWhen
    I get a little more time I'll post some more code about how I had this web part
    auto-generate a default column configuration file for new/edit modes which
    could then be edited to change the order/visibile/editability etc. It's
    pretty trivial though.\n\nCheers, \n\n - Alex"

  Here are some more SharePoint hacks (continuing on from my last<br />
  post <a href="http://blog.bittercoder.com/PermaLink,guid,d9d2ba93-08b4-4495-866e-6a6d9241c02d.aspx">here</a>)<br /><br />
  <br /><br />
  First off some hacks for the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/powlo/archive/2007/02/25/displaying-custom-data-through-sharepoint-lists-using-spgridview-and-spmenufield.aspx">SPGridView</a> which is actually a pretty useful control, but<br />
  fails to do a few things, like displaying attachment columns<br />
  as-per SharePoint's default List views (with a little paper-clip<br />
  symbol), and the second (and much more annoying) it doesn't use<br />
  the current users regional settings / timezone for formatting<br />
  DateTime values.<br /><br />
  <br /><br />
  The hacks:<br /><br />
</p></p>
<ul>
<li>
    <a href="http://wiki.bittercoder.com/AttachmentColumnInSPGridView.ashx">Attachments bound field</a><br />
  </li></p>
<li>
    <a href="http://wiki.bittercoder.com/DatesNotWorkingWithDSTInSPGridView.ashx">Localized DateFime bound field</a><br />
  </li><br />
</ul>And finally support for a ListForm replacement web part -<br />
after trying to customize the ListForm to suit a customers<br />
requirements by creating a CustomListForm in SharePoint designer I<br />
gave up in disgust because it's just too limited in what it lets<br />
you achieve, and worst of all, it breaks attachments support!&nbsp;<br />
So I wrote a small web part to replace it, which allows for<br />
fine-grained control of visibility and editability (if that's even<br />
a word) of each field, and as an added bonus it doesn't break the<br />
attachments functionality.&nbsp; I also wanted to add additional<br />
links/buttons to the form which triggered a save including<br />
validation etc. - so I did a little hack to implement that as<br />
well.<br /></p>
<ul>
<li>
    <a href="http://wiki.bittercoder.com/WebPartToReplaceNewOrEditForm.ashx">Web part to replace New or Edit ListForm</a><br />
  </li></p>
<li>
    <a href="http://wiki.bittercoder.com/AddLinksToEditFormWebPart.ashx">Adding<br />
    links to the Edit Form web part</a><br /><br />
  </li><br />
</ul>I might have a few more to post before the end of the project<br />
- but it's almost wrapped up, so these may be the last for a<br />
while.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Hopefully someone out there finds them useful.<br /></p>
