<p>The Sylvia Park <a href="http:&#47;&#47;wiki.bittercoder.com&#47;SylviaParkArchitectureChats.ashx">Architecture&nbsp;Chat<&#47;a> is to be held this Thursday, 11:30am at <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.garrisonpub.co.nz&#47;default.aspx">Garrisons<&#47;a> in Sylvia&nbsp;Park.</p>
<p>I think we are well and truly into the digestion phase after being&nbsp;flooded with so many product drops and previews over the last few&nbsp;months - announcements are low, but the amount of content about&nbsp;taking advantage of what's finally in our hands is increasing...&nbsp;arguably this is far more interesting&#47;rewarding then actually&nbsp;getting the tech drops in the first place.</p>
<p>At any rate, things that have caught my eye this week (not much as&nbsp;you'll see, I haven't had much opportunity to read blogs over the&nbsp;last few weeks):</p>
<ul>
<li>.Net Framework Source Code <a href="http:&#47;&#47;weblogs.asp.net&#47;scottgu&#47;archive&#47;2008&#47;01&#47;16&#47;net-framework-library-source-code-now-available.aspx">Released<&#47;a> - this is great, but quite strange as well -&nbsp;reading the comments is particularly interesting.<&#47;li>
<li>More <a href="http:&#47;&#47;blog.bittercoder.com&#47;PermaLink,guid,f962b2b9-38ba-4dec-8305-50501e0e21f0.aspx">Lambda abuse<&#47;a> with <a href="http:&#47;&#47;geekswithblogs.net&#47;Podwysocki&#47;archive&#47;2008&#47;01&#47;22&#47;118770.aspx">Design by Contract in C# 3.0<&#47;a>.<&#47;li>
<li>The <a href="http:&#47;&#47;jupitermoonbeam.blogspot.com&#47;2008&#47;01&#47;one-minute-build.html">One Minute Build<&#47;a> - Continuous Integration and Quick Builds.<&#47;li>
<li>Software Transactional Memory <a href="http:&#47;&#47;cs.hubfs.net&#47;blogs&#47;hell_is_other_languages&#47;archive&#47;2008&#47;01&#47;16&#47;4565.aspx">implemented in F#<&#47;a><&#47;li>
<li>F# <a href="http:&#47;&#47;diditwith.net&#47;2008&#47;01&#47;16&#47;WhyILoveFTypesafeFormatStrings.aspx">Type Safe Format Strings<&#47;a> (the fact they're compile time&nbsp;checked has completely escaped me until now).<&#47;li>
<li>F# Programming <a href="http:&#47;&#47;searchwindevelopment.techtarget.com&#47;generic&#47;0,295582,sid8_gci1289090,00.html">Fast Guide<&#47;a>.<&#47;li>
<li>Mindscapes <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.mindscape.co.nz&#47;products&#47;WPFPropertyGrid&#47;">Property&nbsp;Grid for WPF<&#47;a> (one less hurdle for WinForms -> WPF<br />
Conversion, though why didn't it come in the box to begin&nbsp;with?).<&#47;li></p>
<li>Ayendes <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.ayende.com&#47;Blog&#47;archive&#47;2008&#47;01&#47;22&#47;Rhino-Security-Overview-Part-I.aspx">Security Overview<&#47;a> - an enterprise application security&nbsp;solution (very similar in shape to security implementations&nbsp;required for say an ERP or CRM solution).<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
If anyone has any topic suggestions, either fire me a&nbsp;comment&#47;email or just bring yourself along - all are welcome.</p>
