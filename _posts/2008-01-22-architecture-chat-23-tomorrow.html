<p>The Sylvia Park <a href="http://wiki.bittercoder.com/SylviaParkArchitectureChats.ashx">Architecture&nbsp;Chat</a> is to be held this Thursday, 11:30am at <a href="http://www.garrisonpub.co.nz/default.aspx">Garrisons</a> in Sylvia&nbsp;Park.</p>
<p>I think we are well and truly into the digestion phase after being&nbsp;flooded with so many product drops and previews over the last few&nbsp;months - announcements are low, but the amount of content about&nbsp;taking advantage of what's finally in our hands is increasing...&nbsp;arguably this is far more interesting/rewarding then actually&nbsp;getting the tech drops in the first place.</p>
<p>At any rate, things that have caught my eye this week (not much as&nbsp;you'll see, I haven't had much opportunity to read blogs over the&nbsp;last few weeks):</p>
<ul>
<li>.Net Framework Source Code <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2008/01/16/net-framework-library-source-code-now-available.aspx">Released</a> - this is great, but quite strange as well -&nbsp;reading the comments is particularly interesting.</li>
<li>More <a href="http://blog.bittercoder.com/PermaLink,guid,f962b2b9-38ba-4dec-8305-50501e0e21f0.aspx">Lambda abuse</a> with <a href="http://geekswithblogs.net/Podwysocki/archive/2008/01/22/118770.aspx">Design by Contract in C# 3.0</a>.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://jupitermoonbeam.blogspot.com/2008/01/one-minute-build.html">One Minute Build</a> - Continuous Integration and Quick Builds.</li>
<li>Software Transactional Memory <a href="http://cs.hubfs.net/blogs/hell_is_other_languages/archive/2008/01/16/4565.aspx">implemented in F#</a></li>
<li>F# <a href="http://diditwith.net/2008/01/16/WhyILoveFTypesafeFormatStrings.aspx">Type Safe Format Strings</a> (the fact they're compile time&nbsp;checked has completely escaped me until now).</li>
<li>F# Programming <a href="http://searchwindevelopment.techtarget.com/generic/0,295582,sid8_gci1289090,00.html">Fast Guide</a>.</li>
<li>Mindscapes <a href="http://www.mindscape.co.nz/products/WPFPropertyGrid/">Property&nbsp;Grid for WPF</a> (one less hurdle for WinForms -> WPF<br>
Conversion, though why didn't it come in the box to begin&nbsp;with?).</li>
<li>Ayendes <a href="http://www.ayende.com/Blog/archive/2008/01/22/Rhino-Security-Overview-Part-I.aspx">Security Overview</a> - an enterprise application security&nbsp;solution (very similar in shape to security implementations&nbsp;required for say an ERP or CRM solution).</li><br>
</ul><br>
If anyone has any topic suggestions, either fire me a&nbsp;comment/email or just bring yourself along - all are welcome.
