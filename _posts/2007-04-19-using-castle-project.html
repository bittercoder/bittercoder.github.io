<p>I noticed that <a href="http://www.flanders.co.nz/Blog/">Ivan</a><br>
posted a <a href="http://www.flanders.co.nz/Blog/2007/04/19/WantToStartUsingMonorailButDontQuiteKnowHow.aspx"><br>
list of tutorials</a> etc. on his blog... I think it's worth also<br>
adding that there is a site dedicated to these kinds of resources,<br>
as well as snippets, recipes etc.&nbsp; - it's still in it's<br>
infancy, but I think it will end up being quite invaluable as a<br>
resource for castle project users (here's hoping at any<br>
rate!)<br><br>
