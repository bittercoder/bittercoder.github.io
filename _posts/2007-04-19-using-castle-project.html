<p>I noticed that <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.flanders.co.nz&#47;Blog&#47;">Ivan<&#47;a><br />
posted a <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.flanders.co.nz&#47;Blog&#47;2007&#47;04&#47;19&#47;WantToStartUsingMonorailButDontQuiteKnowHow.aspx"><br />
list of tutorials<&#47;a> etc. on his blog... I think it's worth also<br />
adding that there is a site dedicated to these kinds of resources,<br />
as well as snippets, recipes etc.&nbsp; - it's still in it's<br />
infancy, but I think it will end up being quite invaluable as a<br />
resource for castle project users (here's hoping at any<br />
rate!)<br &#47;><br />
