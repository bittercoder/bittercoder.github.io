  content: I should also clarify that I'm using W2K8 server with the Hyper-V role,
    rather then HyperV stand-alone which I've heard is a nightmare platform that I
    didn't really feel like dealing with...

<p>I decided recently to upgrade a couple of commodity hardware&nbsp;staging boxes that were pushed to capacity (and had no viable&nbsp;upgrade path) which I use for hosting Virtual Machines - after a&nbsp;bit of umming and erring on what would be cost effective I ended up<br />
opting for 2 x the following kit:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http:&#47;&#47;processorfinder.intel.com&#47;details.aspx?sSpec=SLAWQ">Q9550<&#47;a>&nbsp;Processor (2.83ghz, but they'll probably end up being clocked&nbsp;around 3ghz or a little above, once I'm happy the boxes are&nbsp;stable).<&#47;li>
<li><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.asus.com&#47;products.aspx?l1=3&amp;l2=11&amp;l3=761&amp;l4=0&amp;model=2413&amp;modelmenu=1">Asus P5Q-EM<&#47;a> Motherboard (cheap, on-board graphics, supports&nbsp;16gig DDR2)<&#47;li>
<li><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.newegg.com&#47;Product&#47;Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820231183">G.SKILL 16gb<&#47;a> DDR2 kit.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
As drop-in replacements these worked out really&nbsp;cost-effective, with the ram being the most expensive part at just&nbsp;under $800 for the kit.</p>
<p>So for around $3K NZ I end up with 32gig of ram and 8 reasonably&nbsp;fast cores - not bad, plenty of bang for buck compared to picking&nbsp;up an equivalent server-spec hardware - and I can avoid the more&nbsp;expensive FB-DIMM (which would have worked out at least $3K for the<br />
RAM alone).</p>
<p>I decided to go with HyperV on these new machines, replacing my&nbsp;existing VMWare Server setup... It's actually been reasonably&nbsp;painless to port my the various machines across, once I got a&nbsp;handle on a few little gotchas:</p>
<p>So for Windows 2K3 virtual servers I've had to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Uninstall the VMWare tools (via add&#47;remove programs).<&#47;li>
<li>Uninstall the VMWare video driver (from the device&nbsp;manager).<&#47;li>
<li>Run the VMWare cleanup utility (I had to do this on a few&nbsp;machines to clean up a "VMWare memory service" that was failing&nbsp;to start after moving the machine to HyperV) - you can grab the&nbsp;tool from the bottom of this <a href="http:&#47;&#47;kb.vmware.com&#47;selfservice&#47;microsites&#47;search.do?cmd=displayKC&amp;docType=kc&amp;externalId=1308&amp;sliceId=2&amp;docTypeID=DT_KB_1_1&amp;dialogID=35946306&amp;stateId=0%200%202719456">KB article<&#47;a> for cleaning them, which works on VM's as well&nbsp;as hosts... in one case I also had to do some registry<br />
spelunking to remove the errant service.<&#47;li></p>
<li>Install an IDE drive (doesn't matter what size, I just set it&nbsp;to the smallest possible value) in the VMWare server - <a href="http:&#47;&#47;social.technet.microsoft.com&#47;Forums&#47;en-US&#47;winserverhyperv&#47;thread&#47;ef8c12f7-c45d-442e-9a30-c43cd87df3b3">see here for details<&#47;a> - not doing this will result in a BSOD&nbsp;if your VMWare server is using virtual SCSI drives, like mine<br />
were.<&#47;li></p>
<li>Shutdown the Virtual machine.<&#47;li>
<li>Convert VMDK VMWare hard drives to VHD's using this&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;vmtoolkit.com&#47;files&#47;folders&#47;converters&#47;entry8.aspx">tool<&#47;a> (ignoring the IDE drives I added).<&#47;li>
<li>Create a new machine, add the drives back in (as IDE drives)&nbsp;in HyperV.<&#47;li>
<li>Boot it up.<&#47;li>
<li>Insert the Integration Services Disk (CTRL+I) - let it do&nbsp;it's thing, and reboot when prompted.<&#47;li>
<li>All done.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
For the few Ubuntu &amp; Debian virtual machines I just:</p>
<ul>
<li>Uninstalled the VMWare tools, if they were installed (I don't&nbsp;always bother with Linux, most of the machines aren't disk or&nbsp;network intensive, so it never seems to make much&nbsp;difference).<&#47;li>
<li>Convert VMDK VMWare hard drives to VHD's using this&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;vmtoolkit.com&#47;files&#47;folders&#47;converters&#47;entry8.aspx">tool<&#47;a>.<&#47;li>
<li>Created a new machine, adding the drives back in (as IDE&nbsp;drives).<&#47;li>
<li>Removed the integrated network adaptor that's added by&nbsp;default and replaced it with the "Legacy network adaptor".<&#47;li>
<li>Boot it up, quickly hit "e" and the edit the grub boot line&nbsp;replacing "root=&#47;dev&#47;sda1" with "root=&#47;dev&#47;hda1".<&#47;li>
<li>At this point it should finish booting (otherwise it'll hang&nbsp;trying to boot and eventually dump you into an (initramfs)&nbsp;prompt).<&#47;li>
<li>Log in, locate "menu.lst" (normally in &#47;boot&#47;grub&#47;) and&nbsp;change references to &#47;dev&#47;sda1 to &#47;dev&#47;hda1, save and reboot (so&nbsp;the change of hard drive for the root filesystem is&nbsp;persisted).<&#47;li>
<li>Optionally install the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;blogs.msdn.com&#47;virtual_pc_guy&#47;archive&#47;2008&#47;09&#47;22&#47;rtm-of-linux-integration-components-for-hyper-v-now-available.aspx">Linux integration components<&#47;a>, though it takes some trial&nbsp;and error to get this working (I'm still fiddling with this a&nbsp;bit when I can be bothered - once working that should allow the&nbsp;virtual machine to stop using the legacy network adaptor and&nbsp;provide improved disk I&#47;O &amp; Network performance).<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
And for the Windows server 2008 virtual machines I skipped the&nbsp;addition of an extra virtual IDE drive prior to conversion, as it&nbsp;just seemed to work (i.e. no BSOD).</p>
<p>So far it's been reasonably painless process... the best part is I&nbsp;now have a plenty of room for some additional build servers to&nbsp;target my own open source projects, host some examples of&nbsp;RESTful&#47;OAuth services etc.</p>
<p><strong>Edit - Feb 1<sup>st<&#47;sup> 2008<&#47;strong>:&nbsp; It should be noted I&nbsp;since moved over to using VMWare server version 2, because I found&nbsp;the performance of HyperV to be diabolical for CPU-intensive tasks&nbsp;i.e. the server would be&nbsp;utilizing&nbsp;only about 10% of the available&nbsp;CPU resources when running continuous integration builds, resulting&nbsp;in builds taking well over 30 minutes instead of the usual 2 or 3 -&nbsp;at the time I found a few other users who suffered from the same&nbsp;problems, but no solution.</p>
<p>At first I thought it might be a result of converting the VMWare&nbsp;machines to HyperV, but freshly paving new build servers didn't&nbsp;make any difference.&nbsp; Moving over to the VMWare server v2&nbsp;yielded very high CPU utilization, with builds that used to take 3&nbsp;minutes on my old build server, nowtaking less then a minute on the&nbsp;new host machine :)</p>
<p>My medium-term plan is to migrate over to ESXi, once I've sourced&nbsp;some Intel server gigabit NIC's, using iSCSI on my openfiler box&nbsp;for storage.</p>
