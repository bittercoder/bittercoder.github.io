<p>Well, I'm now in Siam Reap, home of Angkor Wat, testament of the&nbsp;Cambodian peoples former glory... the town is disturbingly clean&nbsp;in places, and really doesn't seem to fit the rest of Cambodia's&nbsp;"image".&nbsp; However this entry is about Phnom Penh and what I&nbsp;did over the last 2 days there.</p>
<p><strong>Killing Fields</strong></p>
<p>So lets see.. right, it was a drizzly day on the 11th when I got&nbsp;up at 9:30am to head out to see the killing fields, which is&nbsp;about 14km's out of town.&nbsp; You pay $2 US to get in, and&nbsp;effectively what you get is to see a number of exhumed mass&nbsp;graves where the Khmer Rouge dumped the bodies of people after&nbsp;they were either shot, or more often, bludgeoned to death - often&nbsp;these were people who had been undergoing torture at the S-21<br>
facility - but more about that later.</p>
<p>At any rate...&nbsp;Around the various pits are descriptions,&nbsp;such as the delightful sign stating that "this was the tree&nbsp;children were beaten against" and there are small urns of human<br>
bones.&nbsp; Aside from that there is a large Stupa (which&nbsp;basically looks like an Obelisk) which is split into&nbsp;multiple&nbsp;layers, each layer containing many skulls - sorted by age and<br>
gender, in total there are almost 9,000 skulls on display - most&nbsp;showing the evident head trauma that brought there lives to a&nbsp;fairly brutal and now doubt traumatic end.</p>
<p>While standing in the rain I ended up talking to a Khmer man who&nbsp;was there... most of the&nbsp;conversation&nbsp;centred around his family&nbsp;(almost every Khmer person has a tragic story about this period&nbsp;that directly involved there family) - and he introduced me to<br>
his rather practical viewpoint, in that he felt it was a very&nbsp;dangerous time.. but he didn't seem to persue the psychological&nbsp;issues, I say practical in that it seems like one of the only&nbsp;ways you could "get on with business" after a genocide that&nbsp;didn't even end before some of my generation were born.</p>
<p><strong>S-21, Genocide Museum</strong></p>
<p>After that I got back on "Pauls" bike&nbsp;-&nbsp;the driver from&nbsp;the guesthouse - and he took me to S-21, which was originally a&nbsp;school until converted to a detenion and interogation centre to<br>
be used by the Khmer Rouge - first off I will say that this is a&nbsp;wonderful "museum" - I found in really interesting wandering&nbsp;through the compound which is split into four buildings, the<br>
first and the third are basically just displaying the rather&nbsp;depressing compound where people were held - with disturbing&nbsp;fuzzy black and white&nbsp;plates of the last victims of S-21<br>
displayed on the walls of each room/cell (there were 14 people&nbsp;found dead in S-21 after the K.R were overthrown, who are now&nbsp;buried in the middle of the compound).&nbsp; The other two rooms&nbsp;are dedicated to displays of the thousands of potraits taken over<br>
that period of people brought here to confess there crimes -&nbsp;generally under torture, and often measuring into the hundreds of&nbsp;pages (there confessions that is), as well as a number of photo&nbsp;studies with accompanying stories prepared by the dccam<br>
(documentation&nbsp;center&nbsp;of cambodia) <a href="http://www.dccam.org/">http://www.dccam.org/</a>. All very&nbsp;interesting.</p>
<p>As for how it all made me feel... to be honest I&nbsp;wasn't&nbsp;disturbed or peturbed,&nbsp;genocide though&nbsp;unpleasant is a subject I've always found interesting.. &nbsp;but&nbsp;I did become quite curious to know how other people reacted to&nbsp;the sights and generally unusual atmosphere this place exudes&nbsp;(some of the rooms have permanent blood stains on the<br>
tiles)&nbsp;- and thankfully that's no too hard as each room has&nbsp;a journal where people can share there thoughts... some less&nbsp;thoughtful people even shared their thoughts on some of the walls&nbsp;of the other prison buildings, which is pretty disrespectful, but&nbsp;meh.. what can you do?</p>
<p>So, I spent about 3 hours all up in the museum - flicking through&nbsp;journals, staring at black and white photos and reading stories&nbsp;from the era, and formulated a categorisation for peoples&nbsp;reactions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Angry (30%)
<ol>
<li>With comments such as "we will never learn!"</li>
<li>"Polpot was a murdering fuckhead"</li>
<li>The germans haven't learnt</li><br>
</ol><br>
</li>
<li>Apologetic&nbsp;(20%)
<ol>
<li>I'm sorry</li>
<li>We let this happen, why?"</li><br>
</ol><br>
</li>
<li>Supportive (20%)
<ol>
<li>Cambodian People are amazing to get through this.</li><br>
</ol><br>
</li>
<li>Dismal (20%)
<ol>
<li>We will NEVER learn :(</li>
<li>The germans haven't learn't (this was a popular comment&nbsp;from a number of german tourists...??)</li><br>
</ol><br>
</li>
<li>Philosophical (10%)
<ol>
<li>"We are all the same people"</li><br>
</ol><br>
</li>
<li>Practical - only the locals.. percentage wise I dont think it&nbsp;has much mileage
<ol>
<li>Such as the cambodian man, ie. it was dangerous, now it&nbsp;is not dangerous.</li><br>
</ol><br>
</li><br>
</ol><br>
Now, out of all the quotes presented from various people only one&nbsp;seemed worth quoting here, which was from the Goralcyzk family in&nbsp;Poland, and it simply said:
<blockquote style="margin-right: 0px;" dir="ltr"><p>I am from poland, the land of Auschwitz - The famous polish<br>
poet gave a motto: "It was people who gave other people this<br>
fate."</p></blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Which to my mind pretty much encapsulates exactly how I felt&nbsp;about the whole thing.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Wat Phnom</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">I did some other stuff that night, but it's all fairly boring&nbsp;(dinner in town, watching sex tourists doing sex tourist things&nbsp;etc.) - and awoke the next day early and went for a walk to Wat&nbsp;Phnom, a temple on what is known to be the highest *snigger*&nbsp;point in the city of Phnom Penh, at a whopping 27 metres...&nbsp;Walking around this monument you get set on by limbless beggars&nbsp;and small street kids wanting money, but if you make it around to&nbsp;the other side you can sit in the park and feed the monkeys that&nbsp;live in the trees above, or as I like to call them, rabies at&nbsp;arms reach.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Monkeys are incredibly cute, but they seem pretty bloody&nbsp;dangerous to me - easily angered, persistent, sneaky and very&nbsp;quick - I got to watch while a couple of taiwanese tourists who&nbsp;were attacked by&nbsp;one of the&nbsp;monkeys there - I did&nbsp;nothing - and was glad they didn't have their gizzards spilt out,&nbsp;as it would've have ruined my photos, and I'd feel somehow&nbsp;responsible due to my inaction.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>National Museum</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">After that I visited the National Museum.. pretty cool, a very&nbsp;well presented collection of artifacts housed in a lovely old&nbsp;building that has a centre courtyard with a pond and chairs to&nbsp;sit in - really nice - though you can't take pictures, which is a&nbsp;shame.</p>
<p dir="ltr">After that I had lunch, bought a copy of the Bangkok post from a&nbsp;street kid and drank copious cold lemon drinks (the only thing&nbsp;that seems to quench my thirst) - the kids are depressing, and I&nbsp;find them far more disturbing then the genocide because the&nbsp;problem seems resolvable... orphanages and schools, both which&nbsp;already exist in Cambodia.&nbsp; But the devils in the detail I&nbsp;guess...</p>
<p dir="ltr">At any rate, after explaining for the 20th time that I wasn't&nbsp;going to give the news paper back after 10 minutes so he could&nbsp;sell it again (they must be fast readers here :?) I got to finish&nbsp;my lunch in relative peace...&nbsp;though the profit made on one&nbsp;newspaper being sold could probably feed him for a day, so I'm&nbsp;left to wonder just what they're up to.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There's more to the story.. but I'm really hungry, so I'll post&nbsp;this and post some more stuff tomorrow or the day after about&nbsp;events after the fact&nbsp;(heading to see the Angkor temples&nbsp;tomorrow, which should be good, albeit hot work, and I'm even&nbsp;going to attempt to see the sun rise... up before 5am.. blurry&nbsp;hell).</p>
