<p>So, another small turnout last week - but good discussions none the&nbsp;less, with 4 of us in total (Peter, David, Gareth and&nbsp;Myself).</p>
<p>First off we had a talk about <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.slyce.com&#47;Products&#47;ArchAngel&#47;tabid&#47;55&#47;Default.aspx">ArchAngel<&#47;a>,&nbsp;the product that Gareth has architected&#47;written, and what it&nbsp;solves, and around the upcoming release of the new site, as the&nbsp;product moves out of beta - a lot of us have given him grief over&nbsp;the existing DNN site, and it should be good to see it get a face&nbsp;lift ;o) - Following that we talked a little about the challenges&nbsp;of round tripping code, and the problems with a lot of the current&nbsp;MDA&#47;MDG implementations, and how ArchAngel can resolve a lot of&nbsp;pain associated with other code generation approaches due to the&nbsp;holistic approach.&nbsp; It's a very exciting product and hopefully&nbsp;at some point a screen cast or two will be made to demonstrate the&nbsp;various features &#47; advantages of the product (hint hint).</p>
<p>I again voiced my frustrations with SharePoint - or "swearpoint" as&nbsp;David coined it, I think much of my problem has been around lack of&nbsp;good documentation, and finding the right combination of tools for&nbsp;doing the job i.e. not using &nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.microsoft.com&#47;downloads&#47;details.aspx?familyid=19f21e5e-b715-4f0c-b959-8c6dcbdc1057&amp;displaylang=en">VseWSS<&#47;a> projects but instead using <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.codeplex.com&#47;wspbuilder">WSPBuilder<&#47;a>, and getting to&nbsp;grips with the various nuances of deployment packages and the&nbsp;SharePoint 12 etc. folder structure - not the mention the&nbsp;diabolical and misleading exceptions you get at some points - I&nbsp;still haven't found a good approach of TDD'ing that works across&nbsp;event receivers, web parts, controls etc. that doesn't introduce a&nbsp;large&nbsp;amount&nbsp;of uncessary complications and abstracts just to make&nbsp;the untestable testable - For the next SharePoint project (if I&nbsp;dare touch another one) I'll definitely take the time to develop a&nbsp;better TDD approach, and probably buy a tool like <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.typemock.com&#47;">typemock<&#47;a> to assist with it.</p>
<p>I brought up the &nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;weblogs.asp.net&#47;scottgu&#47;archive&#47;2007&#47;10&#47;14&#47;asp-net-mvc-framework.aspx">ASP.Net MVC framework<&#47;a> - with the latest wave of information<br />
coming after the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.altnetconf.com&#47;home&#47;closed">ALT.Net conference<&#47;a>&nbsp;where <a href="http:&#47;&#47;weblogs.asp.net&#47;scottgu&#47;default.aspx">Scott&nbsp;Guthrie<&#47;a> did a &nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.hanselman.com&#47;blog&#47;ScottGuMVCPresentationAndScottHaScreencastFromALTNETConference.aspx">presentation<&#47;a>... and we discussed how it fits in with web forms,&nbsp;and where it leaves <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.castleproject.org&#47;">Monorail<&#47;a> -based on current&nbsp;observations within the monorail community I believe many would&nbsp;consider moving across to the ASP.Net MVC platform based on what&nbsp;has been presented so far, though the approach and architecture is&nbsp;similar enough that there should be opportunities to easily shim&nbsp;view components etc. To work with both MVC frameworks.</p>
<p>After that we had some rambling discussions about Accessibility&nbsp;(including web browsing for the blind, designing accessible forms,&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.w3.org&#47;MarkUp&#47;Forms&#47;">x-forms<&#47;a>, tables vs.&nbsp;div's for web forms and how nothing done for local&#47;central&nbsp;government really conforms with their accessibility requirements,&nbsp;or is even tested for accessibility.</p>
<p>Intertwined with that conversation was the rather slow adoption of&nbsp;WPF (I mentioned some of the points brought up in recent <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.dotnetrocks.com&#47;default.aspx?ShowNum=280">panel&nbsp;discussion<&#47;a> that was on <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.dotnetrocks.com&#47;">.Net Rocks!<&#47;a>), WPF &amp;&nbsp;Silverlight control suites and the power of <a href="http:&#47;&#47;msdn2.microsoft.com&#47;en-us&#47;library&#47;ms752347.aspx">filters&nbsp;and binding<&#47;a>, also include in that discussion I briefly&nbsp;mentioned that I'd been working on building a web based workflow&nbsp;designer application using the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.openjacob.org&#47;">OpenJacob<&#47;a> library (the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.openjacob.org&#47;draw2d.html">draw2d<&#47;a> javascript&nbsp;library to precise) and Monorail with some success, but would like&nbsp;an off-the-shelf WPF or better yet Silver light toolkit to do the&nbsp;same job.</p>
<p>Last of all we discussed Alex James's proposed question around&nbsp;thoughts on POCO (plain old code&#47;c# objects) and how important it&nbsp;was to us (in association with ORM's &#47; Domain Driven Design, or at&nbsp;least thats what we talked about).</p>
<p>The thoughts were basically:</p>
<ul>
<li>Single inheritance makes non-POCO based Orm's a pain to work&nbsp;with in some cases, i.e. there's a loss of control, and&nbsp;accommodating some scenarios such as MarshalByRef become&nbsp;difficult&#47;impossible.<&#47;li>
<li>Can often make it harder to enforce correct usage of your&nbsp;domain model, such as aggregates.<&#47;li>
<li>Depending on the ORM, non-POCO objects are harder to test&nbsp;with in a disconnected manor.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
On the flip side:</p>
<ul>
<li>Incorporating concepts like current&#47;previous value can be&nbsp;more natural.<&#47;li>
<li>Performance &#47; ease of development for the ORM can be&nbsp;simplified when not accommodating POCO.&nbsp;You generally need to rely on proxying and virtual methods to&nbsp;make POCO possible, this can introduce additional complexity and<&#47;li>
<li>small performance hits both on startup and at run-time (not&nbsp;generally that noticeable).<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
I also took the opportunity to once again mention <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.postsharp.org&#47;">PostSharp<&#47;a> - which I've been using&nbsp;to prototype methods for removing a lot of the repetitive or ugly&nbsp;plumbing code that developers often have to write when developing&nbsp;non-POCO entities.</p>
<p>Oh, and sorry about the late write up! .. Things have been a bit&nbsp;crazy lately and I've been hard pushed to find the time to post&nbsp;this till now, I'll do better with the next chat and try and get&nbsp;that writen up in a more timely manor (a 1 to 2 day&nbsp;turn-around).</p>
<p>Last of all - our next chat is Thursday this week - hopefully we&nbsp;can push our numbers back up to 6 or 8 and catch up with some of&nbsp;the other regulars who haven't been able to make it over the last&nbsp;month and half - and as usual, if you have any topic suggestions,&nbsp;just drop me a comment&#47;email etc. and I'll bring it up at the next&nbsp;chat.</p>
