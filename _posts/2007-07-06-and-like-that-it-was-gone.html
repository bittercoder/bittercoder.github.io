    Can't agree more about the full snapshots... I have to admit to a little slackness on my part as I only built the machine a month prior, and was contemplating reverting it back to XP from Vista64.

    I might give Acronis a look, see if it suits my needs.

<p>Well I've had a highly unproductive afternoon scrambling to rebuild my development PC after the RAID 5 decided to kill itself off... at first the pc reported one disk had fallen out of the raid... I brought it back in, rebooted, the machine started rebuilding the array then rebooted itself.. at which point it declared each disk was a member of different array... stuffed around with it for about an hour and contemplated throwing a 750gig drive in and doing a software-based recovery... but considering last time I did something like that it took a number of <strong>days</strong> to complete, I decided to just heave a large sigh, break the array up into individual disks and re-install (without RAID-5 this time...).</p>
<p>Thankfully between svn, google apps (gmail for domains, google reader) and del.icio.us I don't think a lot has slipped through the gaps, barring the odd bit of skype history.</p>
<p>Guess I know what I'll be doing this weekend.&nbsp; bleh!</p>
