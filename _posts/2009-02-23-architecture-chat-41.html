  content: No log sorry - the write-up above is as close as you get I'm afraid.  I
    have considered recording audio in the past, but I don't really have the time
    to edit the two hours of conversation to remove portions involving confidential
    discussions of local businesses etc. - plus I suspect a few our regular attendees
    don't want to be immortalised in sound on the web :)

<p>Last architecture chat was a fairly small turnout, and as such we&nbsp;ended up having a fairly focused conversation mostly around&nbsp;NHibernate, here's what we talked about on the day:</p>
<ul>
<li>The rise of interest in <a href="http://www.hibernate.org/343.html">NHibernate</a> recently.</li>
<li>The NHibernate 3rd party tooling market and side projects.</li>
<li style="list-style: none; display: inline;">
<ul>
<li><a href="http://nhprof.com/">NHibernate Profiler</a>.</li>
<li>NHibernate Search, NHibernate Burrow etc. in <a href="http://nhcontrib.wiki.sourceforge.net/">NHibernate&nbsp;Contrib</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://fluentnhibernate.org/">Fluent&nbsp;NHibernate</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://using.castleproject.org/display/Contrib/ActiveWriter"> ActiveWriter</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://blogs.hibernatingrhinos.com/nhibernate/archive/2008/11/26/linq-to-nhibernate.aspx"> Linq for NHibernate</a> and just how complete it is...</li>
<li><a href="http://ayende.com/Blog/archive/2007/06/05/NHibernate-Query-Generator--More-Collections-Magic.aspx"> NHibernate Query Generator</a>.</li><br>
</ul><br>
</li>
<li>What tooling / projects for NHibernate could increase&nbsp;developer velocity.</li>
<li>NHibernate discussion around a number of points:</li>
<li style="list-style: none; display: inline;">
<ul>
<li>Single table / class table inheritance.</li>
<li>Can you mix both the types of inheritance together.</li>
<li>Can a discriminator cross multiple columns.</li>
<li>Discriminator mapping over a range i.e. CreatedDate <&nbsp;2003, instantiate="" a="" goldcustomer,="" otherwise="" if="" createddate&nbsp;="">= 2003 instantiate a premium custom (change in customer&nbsp;structuring post 2003).</&nbsp;2003,></li>
<li>Ability to support stored procedures in NHibernate where&nbsp;parameters are not in the expected order, or if multiple&nbsp;stored proc calls are required to persist an entity and&nbsp;possible work-arounds.</li>
<li>Custom column types, limitations etc.</li><br>
</ul><br>
</li>
<li>General ORM questions</li>
<li style="list-style: none; display: inline;">
<ul>
<li>Does the ORM with the best tooling with out long-term for&nbsp;.Net?</li><br>
</ul><br>
</li>
<li>Obfuscation and License Products.</li>
<li style="list-style: none; display: inline;">
<ul>
<li>Why is it such a problematic space...</li>
<li>The issues people have.</li>
<li>The pain of rolling your own.</li>
<li>References to the post from Ayende on his <a href="http://ayende.com/Blog/archive/2009/02/02/open-letter-to-xheo-that-is-not-a-good-way.aspx"> problems with XHEO</a>.</li><br>
</ul><br>
</li>
<li>Refund policies of software product companies (especially&nbsp;components/libraries for developers).</li>
<li style="list-style: none; display: inline;">
<ul>
<li>Why companies get stubborn about refunds.</li>
<li>Just how many refund requests companies get (consensus -&nbsp;not that many).</li>
<li>The associated cost of bad service with considering&nbsp;reactions being represented in public (blogs, twitter etc.).</li>
<li>The point at which most companies should offer a refund,&nbsp;and should they offer it before the customer asks ex. if they&nbsp;can not resolve their issues in a timely manor (or at all)&nbsp;before eroding the money earned from the sale in the first&nbsp;place.</li><br>
</ul><br>
</li>
<li><a href="http://factorcode.org/">Factor</a> - briefly talked&nbsp;about it before we finished up, I think I'm going to give up&nbsp;trying to get other people interested in it :) postfix notation&nbsp;and stacks just seems to conjure up thoughts of assembler in&nbsp;most developers minds.</li><br>
</ul><br>
Next chat is this Thursday, 26th of February at 11:30am.
