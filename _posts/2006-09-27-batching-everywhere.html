  It seems like batching is a data access "theme" at the moment (much like Castle, IOC &amp; IronPython are all themes in the NZ Blogspace at the moment... even though none of them could be considered new, I've been using Castle IoC container for 1 &amp; 1/2 years now!) - no sooner do I discover the batching support in the <a href="http://www.ayende.com/78/section.aspx/download/117">Rhino.Commons</a> library, it appears NHibernate now supports it in the <a href="http://www.ayende.com/Blog/Trackback.aspx?guid=29efd2f9-5c02-4195-b06e-0695623533c6">latest beta drop</a> and it's a planned feature for the upcoming <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/tomholl/archive/2006/09/26/773213.aspx">version 3 of the enterprise library</a> ... It's interesting that this support never made it's way into the framework itself for version 2.0, it's all but there.<br><br>
  <br><br>
On the flip side, for NHibernate at least, the performance boons of batching are impressive (see below for an image from Ayende's blog where he's done some profiling), I haven't checked Base4.net out in a while, but I wonder if <a href="http://www.base4.net/Blog.aspx">Alex James</a> has had a chance to implement batching support yet? - maybe I should make that my task for the weekend (checking out base4.net again that is heh... not implementing support ;o)<br><br>
