<h2>(Long) Shortcuts</h2></p>
<p>Shortcuts are a basic concept in installers... and doing them with WiX is easy... <span stylesrc="text-decoration: underline">once</span> you know how... I just spent the last 10 minutes trying to get an Icon assigned to an advertised shortcut, here's how you do it...<br /><br />
<br /></p>
<pre>
<Component Id="StandAloneApplication" Guid="C8D5DB05-2D68-40e8-88D1-EF5BEA18DBE1"><br />
  <File Id="SomeCompanySomeProductHostApp"<br />
        Name="SomeCompany.SomeProduct.HostApp.exe"<br />
        DiskId="1"<br />
        Source="....buildSomeCompany.SomeProduct.HostApp.exe"<br />
        Vital="yes"></p>
<p>    <Shortcut Advertise="yes"<br />
              Id="SomeCompanySomeProductHostAppShortcut"<br />
              Directory="ProgramMenuDir"<br />
              Name="My Product"<br />
              WorkingDirectory="INSTALLDIR"<br />
              Description="SomeProduct Application"<br />
              Icon="HostAppShortcutIcon.exe"></p>
<p>      <Icon Id="HostAppShortcutIcon.exe"<br />
            SourceFile="....buildSomeCompany.SomeProduct.HostApp.exe" /></p>
<p>    </Shortcut><br />
  </File><br />
</Component><br />
</pre><br /><br />
The oddity is the way the Icon must be named with an ".exe" extension for it to work....&nbsp; For non-advertised shortcuts you can get away with just leaving the icon out altogether.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Now something else my client wanted that I had to wrestle with a bit... how to create an uninstall shortcut for your product in the program menu's directory... here's how I achieved it, by creating a shortcut to msiexec.exe - I'm damn sure there must be easier way though, this is very clunky, but at least it works for now - if anyone knows an easier way then drop me a comment...</p>
<p>Personally I think uninstall links in the program menu are a waste of time... but in this case I wasn't the target audience I guess :P<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<b>Note:</b> The "$(var.PRODUCTGUID)" refers to a constant being passed to WiX from my continuous integration build (I have a custom msbuild task for generating a single unique productId guid per revision in SVN)...<br /><br />
<br /><br />
First off I define a couple of custom actions...<br /><br />
<br /></p>
<pre><CustomAction Id="SetUninstallArgs" Property="UNINSTALLARGS" Value="/x $(var.PRODUCTGUID)" /><br />
<CustomAction Id="SetUninstallCmd" Property="UNINSTALLCMD" Value="MSIEXEC.EXE" /><br />
</pre></p>
<p>
  I then evaluate them as part of the "InstallExecuteSequence" ...   this doesn't actually have to be run before  "FindRelatedProducts"... you can evaluate them quite late in the installation process.<br /><br />
  <br /><br />
</p></p>
<pre><InstallExecuteSequence>  <Custom Action="SetUninstallArgs" Before="FindRelatedProducts" /><br />
  <Custom Action="SetUninstallCmd" Before="FindRelatedProducts" /><br />
</pre><br />
<br /><br />
And then we can create our shortcut...<br /><br />
<br /></p>
<pre>
<Component Id="Uninstaller" Guid="0454D0FC-190C-42c9-9506-DBA17DECBCB2">    <RegistryKey Action="createAndRemoveOnUninstall" Root="HKCU" Key="SoftwareMyProductUninstaller"><br />
    <RegistryValue Value="" Type="string" KeyPath="yes" /><br />
  </RegistryKey><br />
  <Shortcut Id="InvokeRemove" Name="Uninstall" Target="[UNINSTALLCMD]" Arguments="[UNINSTALLARGS]" WorkingDirectory="SystemDir" Directory="ProgramMenuDir" Description="Uninstall" /><br />
</Component><br />
</pre><br /><br />
You might be wondering why I place a dummy registry entry in there... well it's because otherwise you end up with an <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/msi/setup/ice38.asp">ICE 38</a> error - which seems daft to me, but then I don't really know enough about the windows installer architecture to dispute ICE's errors ;o) (ICE stands for Internal Consistency Evaluator(s) - which is used to validate the installer produced by WiX - have a <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa369206.aspx">look here</a> for more info).<br /><br />
<br /><br />
At any rate... I like the way WiX works... I would never go back to a gui-based setup project tool again, they might be fine for small projects, but once your project grows it just starts to suck hard... why? well... 4 reasons off the top of my head:<br /></p>
<ul>
<li>You can't diff between versions easily... just what did you coworker change in the setup last checkin?<br />
  </li></p>
<li>Lack of global search and replace...<br />
  </li></p>
<li>Generally a little more difficult to fit into CI builds.<br />
  </li></p>
<li>Some of the products require you to use regasm or CLR code to register assemblies for com interop.<br /><br />
  </li><br />
</ul>I just wish there was a decent cookbook... WiX has been going for over 2 years now, and It still seems a little hard to find decent information, I mostly rely on the official stuff... and of course examining how some open source projects have build their installers.<br /></p>
<ul>
<li>
    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_id=39978">The wix user group</a> on sourceforge.<br />
  </li></p>
<li>
    <a href="http://www.wixwiki.com/">The wix wiki</a> - though it's a little light on content in places.<br /><br />
  </li></p>
<li>
    <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa372866.aspx">Windows installer reference</a> on MSDN.<br />
  </li><br />
</ul>I might post a little bit on upgrades next time, that's the other task that took me a little time to get sorted, might proove useful to someone starting out with WiX... who could say.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
BTW - I haven't forgotten about my LINQ series... It's just on the back burner at the moment.</p>
