<p>So plenty of subjects today, though a small'ish turn-out, kinda&nbsp;goes with the time of year, and is probably also related to the&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;barcamp.org&#47;BarCampAgileWellington">bar camp&nbsp;Agile<&#47;a> down in Wellington tomorrow, which I know at least one of&nbsp;the regulars is heading to.</p>
<p>Code protection and obfuscation was floated by <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.slyce.com&#47;">Garreth<&#47;a> - sparked off by his need to&nbsp;find a new code protection production, as the product he currently&nbsp;uses doesn't appear to be under development any longer (<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.eziriz.com&#47;">.Net Reactor<&#47;a> I believe was the&nbsp;product).</p>
<p>In fact, it's worse than that - he suspects that the Author may&nbsp;have had an accident or something similar, because the releases&nbsp;stopped a few months back and the Author is no longer replying to&nbsp;questions or queries on the forum, but prior to that was a very&nbsp;active individual - He can't even be contacted by cell phone. &nbsp;Incidentally if anyone reading this knows of the Author or his fate&nbsp;personally, we'd love to find out more.</p>
<p>Right - so deploying key logic on web-services and some of the&nbsp;alternative licensing products having a requirement of a windows&nbsp;service being installed alongside the product got discussed, with&nbsp;the good and the bad points - it was interesting to see that most&nbsp;of us didn't mind having a windows service installed on our machine&nbsp;to license the product, as long as it was well behaved and made it&nbsp;abundantly&nbsp;clear that this was being done by the product, and was&nbsp;named&#47;described well (so you knew just what it was) - Garreth just<br />
wanted to confirm this with some fellow developers because he's&nbsp;looking into a range of products including PRO-Tector from <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.nalpeiron.com&#47;products&#47;">Nalpeiron<&#47;a> that uses this&nbsp;approach, and was worried he might get too much "kick back" from&nbsp;his target customers (i.e. other developers).</p>
<p>From there we moved onto obfuscation products - we've talked about&nbsp;these before, including &nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.preemptive.com&#47;products&#47;dotfuscator&#47;index.html?source=Adwords&amp;gclid=CKijzZDMkpACFRdPagod9yCJ_A">Dofuscator<&#47;a> and <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.smartassembly.com&#47;">SmartAssembly<&#47;a> which came highly&nbsp;recommended from <a href="http:&#47;&#47;andrewpeters.net&#47;">Andrew<&#47;a> @&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.mindscape.co.nz&#47;">Mindscape<&#47;a>.</p>
<p>All of this rounded up with a discussion around "should you even&nbsp;bother obfuscating" and the rationale behind Microsoft obfuscating&nbsp;key portions of their technologies such as SharePoint or Dynamics&nbsp;CRM (i.e. not just protecting IP, but perhaps protecting volatile<br />
and undocumented behaviour which you might leverage or rely on&nbsp;which could be broken easily between service packs for even the&nbsp;same version of the product).</p>
<p>Garreth also recommended <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.kagi.com&#47;index.php">Kagi<&#47;a> that none of us had heard&nbsp;of - which is a great e-commerce solutions&#47;services provider that&nbsp;goes above and beyond using alternatives like Paypal or local&nbsp;credit card merchants, key differentiating points he made<br />
were:</p>
<ul>
<li>It takes care of varying Tax legislation etc.&nbsp;so you don't personally need to think about collecting VAT etc. -&nbsp;because they act as a "reseller' for your product.<&#47;li>
<li>Supports non-electronic processing i.e.&nbsp;Cheques, purchase orders, direct debit etc.<&#47;li>
<li>Entirely customizable UI, can be entirely&nbsp;gutted and made to look like your own site.<&#47;li>
<li>It understands selling Software and digital&nbsp;content, and provides call backs so you can integrate custom&nbsp;license generation etc.&nbsp; Within the payment site and&nbsp;provisioning workflow.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
It could be just the ticket if your thinking of selling some&nbsp;software and don't want to completely roll your own solution.</p>
<p>Next I ran quickly through the various product announcements etc.&nbsp;over the last 3 weeks - We pretty much bypassed everything and&nbsp;headed straight to Silverlight 2.0 and <a href="http:&#47;&#47;labs.live.com&#47;volta&#47;">Volta<&#47;a> (VS2008 is old news&nbsp;already, though the Isolated VS2008 Shell got a mention, however&nbsp;most were shocked at the size of the redistributable component -&nbsp;<strong>315MB<&#47;strong> - that's a big ask if you want to leverage it for a&nbsp;simple product&#47;project).</p>
<p>I was also hoping to get back to talking about the ParalellFX CTP&nbsp;which I've also been playing around with - but never got the&nbsp;opportunity.</p>
<p>So Volta has featured in previous discussions - some of us didn't&nbsp;even imagine it would see the light of day - yet we now have a&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;labs.live.com&#47;volta&#47;download&#47;">preview<&#47;a> in our<br />
hot little hands which can be played with - I took it for a test&nbsp;drive this morning, and miraculously it works!?</p>
<p>With naught but an attribute I was happily able to move code&nbsp;between my client script and server... We discussed the&nbsp;implications of this, the intended audience (It looks very<br />
appealing to existing win forms developers who have resisted until&nbsp;now from engaging a web platform, because it feels very&nbsp;"familiar").</p>
<p>I'm quite keen to take an existing windows forms application and&nbsp;see how easily I can move from thick client to web client&#47;server&nbsp;using this approach i.e. just how much of the existing code base,&nbsp;event driven structure etc. can be maintained - even in its current<br />
state I think it could do a pretty good job of converting some&nbsp;winforms apps I've built in the past, short of re-implementing&nbsp;complex visual controls.</p>
<p>Things I've still yet to try:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unit testing with NUnit (can't see why it wouldn't work&nbsp;though)<&#47;li>
<li>Introducing additional tiers i.e. tier splitting between an&nbsp;application server, webservice and client script (not sure this&nbsp;works when using Visual Studio at the moment - the release notes&nbsp;suggest "no", so will probably require some spelunking and&nbsp;command line compilation at this stage.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
We talked about Silverlight 2.0, its release date (probably&nbsp;near the end of Q1 2008) - and just what ships and what doesn't&nbsp;i.e. is there a compiler and does it live on the server, extensible&nbsp;control model, 2-way data binding etc.&nbsp; Certainly Silverlight&nbsp;2.0 is looking very comprehensive, and the Silverlight team look to&nbsp;have been&#47;are very busy (I wonder how on track the Moonlight team&nbsp;are, considering the surface area of things to develop has grown&nbsp;somewhat from the original 1.1 scope).</p>
<p>Next we talked about DSL's ... what makes a DSL... the stages of&nbsp;DSL'ness from the "barely there" Fluent interface, through to&nbsp;varying grades of internal DSL and finally a custom language which&nbsp;requires parsing into a syntax tree (which F# is great for I think)<br />
and being consumed by your application, or a Visually depicted DSL,&nbsp;ah-la Microsofts DSL SDK for VS.Net.</p>
<p>In the same conversation we also talked about operator overloading,&nbsp;making things explicit, avoiding operators all together (i.e. &nbsp;"A == B" is far less meaningful in relation to a domain specific&nbsp;language then "A.Equals(B)" or even better "A equals B" - i.e.<br />
being terse may prevent your DSL from being explicit enough to be&nbsp;read by the people who best understand the domain language and the&nbsp;concepts it's modeling to begin with.</p>
<p>We also talked about the things which make a internal DSL work well&nbsp;with languages like Boo i.e. the ability to drop braces, and&nbsp;whitespace awareness (which I hated, but I'm gravitating back&nbsp;towards liking it once more in the right context, because a couple<br />
of spaces is a lot nicer to read then opening&#47;closing braces and&nbsp;associated visual noise - and it's easier to show the raw code to&nbsp;clients when discussing problems because it's less&nbsp;confusing).</p>
<p>Along the same line we talked about operator overloading&nbsp;conventions and on a side note Peter gave Algol a mention for&nbsp;having such wonderful (!) set of operators and needing a special&nbsp;keyboard or a memory for keystroke combos ;o)</p>
<p>?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ??, ?*, %?, ?, ?:=, ?:=, ??:=, ?*:=,<br />
%?:=, ~ ?, ?,?::=,:?:, :,::, ::=...</p>
<p>He also mentioned Postscript, though I don't know much about its&nbsp;operators etc. and didn't really feel like digging up some samples&nbsp;from the red book.&nbsp; Incidentally F# lets you define new&nbsp;operators:</p>
<pre>let ( <:-> ) a b = string.Format("{0} is happy about {1}", a, b) let ( <%=> ) a b = string.Format("{0} is confused by {1}", a, b) let m = "mort" <:-> "user defined operators" let n = "but mort" <%=> "his own code" let result = Console.WriteLine("{0}, {1}", m, n)<&#47;pre><br />
Which of course displays:</p>
<p><strong>mort is happy about user defined operators, but mort is confused<br />
by his own code.<&#47;strong></p>
<p>From there we branched into discussing multi-language projects -&nbsp;i.e. why do we need to have separate languages in separate&nbsp;assemblies... a lot of us fondly remember the old days of in-line&nbsp;assembler, and would like opportunities to use a language like F#,&nbsp;Boo or one of the DLR based languages in-line within a C# or VB.Net&nbsp;project - i.e. within the bounds of a function&#47;method... I see F#&nbsp;pattern matching as a great example of where this would be really&nbsp;handy - same goes for embedding your own DSL's in-line, or even&nbsp;leveraging a few lines of concise ruby code to do some string&nbsp;manipulation.</p>
<p>I suggested a compiler model much like Boo's would work well in&nbsp;allowing this to happen - though there are issues with just how you&nbsp;compile it, approach merging the separate chunks of IL etc. and&nbsp;cross-referencing.</p>
<p>PDF file parsing got discussed - there is a binary and text based&nbsp;standard (which is largely human readable) - Peter suggested that&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.websupergoo.com&#47;abcpdf-8.htm">ABC PDF<&#47;a> is&nbsp;very good at pulling apart PDF documents for information extraction&nbsp;in the Enterprise edition, and also supports CMYK colour, useful if&nbsp;you're working with professional printers.&nbsp; Because there&nbsp;isn't much metadata stored in many cases, you often have to rely on&nbsp;specific style information to identify key bits of content.</p>
<p>We then had a talk about model driven architecture, and in&nbsp;particular, integrating UML models, code and business related&nbsp;information such as device and install inventories, and product&nbsp;life cycle information - we're finally starting to see some&nbsp;traction in New Zealand in this space, and it's ushering in the&nbsp;rise of the true "<a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Enterprise_architect">Enterprise&nbsp;Architect<&#47;a>", with people becoming more aware of frameworks for&nbsp;Enterprise Architecture such as Zachman, TOGAF etc. and realizing&nbsp;the true value of driving from an ultimate and largely strategic<br />
high-level organizational model of past, present and future systems&nbsp;(including when certain systems are going to be retired), all the&nbsp;way down to individual applications, business processes, use cases,&nbsp;test scripts&#47;runs, classes, unit tests, machine inventories and&nbsp;even live application data that can be used to be make decisions...&nbsp;even as a develop this has real value, i.e. integrating with a&nbsp;system you could identify how many systems integrate with it, when&nbsp;it's due to retired&#47;replaced&#47;upgraded, maybe how many transactions&nbsp;it's processing, or how often it refreshes itself with key business&nbsp;data from other parts of the organization.&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw a&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.sparxsystems.com.au&#47;press&#47;articles&#47;iag_casestudy.html">nice&nbsp;example<&#47;a> of this just last week at the &nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;blog.bittercoder.com&#47;PermaLink,guid,e005f3a1-4401-4111-8708-a55c101815e4.aspx">EA Symposium<&#47;a> presented by <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.iag.com.au&#47;">IAG<&#47;a>.</p>
<p>It's definitely a subject I'd like to visit again in the future,&nbsp;and perhaps we can get one of the NZ experts in this field to come&nbsp;and participate such as <a href="http:&#47;&#47;blog.svoboda.co.nz&#47;">Lukas&nbsp;Svodba<&#47;a> (who also runs the&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.arcast.co.nz&#47;">arcast.co.nz<&#47;a> site) - this also ties&nbsp;in with MDA and MDG, The later of which I'm still having difficulty&nbsp;reconciling with a largely agile test driven development&nbsp;process.</p>
<p>Also on that note I mentioned the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.jetbrains.com&#47;mps&#47;">JetBrains meta programming&nbsp;system<&#47;a> and wondered if it will ever reach a v1 status, I had&nbsp;high hopes for it a couple of years ago.&nbsp; It doesn't seem to&nbsp;have had much activity associated with it over the last couple of&nbsp;years (I almost wonder if it was largely an Idea which was well&nbsp;before it's time for a lot of the .Net community, that are only now&nbsp;starting to appreciate DSL's and considering working&#47;developing at&nbsp;a higher level of abstraction - or lower level if you look at it&nbsp;from the perspective of the problem your trying to solve i.e.&nbsp;closer the metal of the problem domain itself).</p>
<p>We pretty much wrapped it up there, so that's year 1 of the&nbsp;Architecture Chats brought to a close (we decided against one more&nbsp;for this year, because of the holidays and not to mention our venue&nbsp;being overrun with rampant shoppers, probably removing any chance&nbsp;of finding a park or hearing ourselves think!)</p>
<p>Big thanks to <a href="http:&#47;&#47;blogs.msdn.com&#47;alexj&#47;">Alex James<&#47;a>&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;blogs.msdn.com&#47;alexj&#47;">(Meta me)<&#47;a> for getting this chat off the ground, and thanks to&nbsp;all the regulars who come along every fortnight - you've all helped&nbsp;to make the Architecture chat one of the most successful and&nbsp;interesting recurring events I've had the pleasure of&nbsp;attending&#47;participating in - and it's been great to have been able&nbsp;to swap ideas and information over the last year.</p>
<p>Have a merry Xmas and a happy new year one and all!</p>
