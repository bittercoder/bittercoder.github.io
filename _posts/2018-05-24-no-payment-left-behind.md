title: PAYMENTSfn - No payments left behind
---

Today I presented at the PAYMENTSfn conference in Durham, North Carolina.

I talked about the payment resilience journey we have gone over in the last 4 years at Pushpay.

[You can find the slides here](https://blog.bittercoder.com/slides/PaymentsFN-no-payment-left-behind.pdf)

Thanks for everyone who came to see my talk, I really enjoyed being able to share both some of our experiences at Pushpay with other payment engineers folks, and to connect with so many other people working through the same problem spaces we are.
