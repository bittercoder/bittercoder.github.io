    I have to agree on all those counts - I decided to go along just to see what angle they are coming from (and to give some voice to the Micro ISV &amp; Tech grant funded project space in Auckland) but I think it could do with being a little more outcome-focused - I don't really know what to expect myself.

    I also need to get my head around the Bizspark offering as well and see if it offers much to me or some of the ideas I've had brewing in the past few years that I might like to work on in the next couple of years.

    If I hear any more info from the Microsoft NZ crew I'll let you know.

<p>Just a quick reminder, as I had a brief call with Paul Lo&nbsp;(from Microsoft) this morning and they haven't really got enough&nbsp;attendees in Auckland (come on Auckland, when will we shake off our&nbsp;developer apathy from the last couple of years?!)</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/nzdev/archive/2008/10/09/your-chance-to-tell-us-what-you-think-about-microsoft.aspx">More details here</a></p>
<p>There is swag too (but that's not a good reason to attend of&nbsp;course).</p>
<p>I'm going to be at Session 6 (11:00am onwards) so hopefully I'll&nbsp;see some of you there.</p>
