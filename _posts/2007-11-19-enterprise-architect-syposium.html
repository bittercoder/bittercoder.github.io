<p>For those that are interested, there is an <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.catch.net.nz&#47;index.php?page=Enterprise_Architect_Symposium"> Enterprise Architect Symposium<&#47;a> being held in Auckland and&nbsp;Wellington at the end of this month (Thursday 29<sup>th<&#47;sup> November in Auckland, and Friday 30<sup>th<&#47;sup> November in Wellington) - click on the image or link above to see a schedule or to register interest.</p>
<p>There are some interesting nuggets there for an architect&#47;analyst, especially around model driven architecture&#47;generation and UI&#47;UX prototyping - with people presenting from <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.sparxsystems.com.au&#47;">Sparx Systems<&#47;a> in Australia (the company which develops Enterprise Architect), <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.catch.net.nz&#47;">Catch Limited<&#47;a> and a number of business in New Zealand including the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.northshorecity.govt.nz&#47;">North Shore City Council<&#47;a> and <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.iag.co.nz&#47;">IAG<&#47;a>.</p>
