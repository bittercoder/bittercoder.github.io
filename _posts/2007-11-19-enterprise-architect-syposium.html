<p>For those that are interested, there is an <a href="http://www.catch.net.nz/index.php?page=Enterprise_Architect_Symposium"> Enterprise Architect Symposium</a> being held in Auckland and&nbsp;Wellington at the end of this month (Thursday 29<sup>th</sup> November in Auckland, and Friday 30<sup>th</sup> November in Wellington) - click on the image or link above to see a schedule or to register interest.</p>
<p>There are some interesting nuggets there for an architect/analyst, especially around model driven architecture/generation and UI/UX prototyping - with people presenting from <a href="http://www.sparxsystems.com.au/">Sparx Systems</a> in Australia (the company which develops Enterprise Architect), <a href="http://www.catch.net.nz/">Catch Limited</a> and a number of business in New Zealand including the <a href="http://www.northshorecity.govt.nz/">North Shore City Council</a> and <a href="http://www.iag.co.nz/">IAG</a>.</p>
