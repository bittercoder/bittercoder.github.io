<p>Good turn out at the last Architecture chat, including Guy, who&nbsp;hadn't been to one for over a year, and Murray, a new comer.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://secunia.com/">Secunia</a> Corporate Software&nbsp;Scanner - How to identify missing patches etc.</li>
<li>Discussed the <a href="http://97-things.near-time.net/wiki">97 things every software architect should know</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Beautiful-Architecture-Leading-Thinkers-Software/dp/059651798X">Beautiful Architecture</a> books - I'll bring them along next&nbsp;time if anyone wants to borrow them.</li>
<li>Discussed Facebook's key/value database <a href="%20http://incubator.apache.org/cassandra/">Cassandra</a>.</li>
<li>Discussed approaches for publishing and consuming RSS, talked&nbsp;about <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/">PubSub&nbsp;Hubbub</a>.</li>
<li>Discussed selecting technologies for building CRUD Apps, and&nbsp;what are good technologies for learning ORM.</li>
<li style="list-style: none; display: inline;">
<ul>
<li>Discussed <a href="https://www.hibernate.org/343.html">NHibernate</a> being the&nbsp;Swiss army knife, lots of features, interesting place to&nbsp;learn as you will become aware with almost every facet of ORM&nbsp;nomenclature etc.</li>
<li style="list-style: none; display: inline;">
<ul>
<li>Discussed <a href="http://www.summerofnhibernate.com/">Summer of&nbsp;NHibernate</a> series of screen casts / tutorials.</li><br />
</ul><br />
</li></p>
<li>Discussed <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/adonet/archive/tags/Entity+Framework/default.aspx"> Entity Framework</a>, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb386976.aspx">Linq2Sql</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;and others including <a href="http://www.mindscape.co.nz/products/lightspeed/">Lightspeed</a>.</li>
<li>Discussed difference between highly opinionated vs.&nbsp;non-opinionated ORM's.</li><br />
</ul><br />
</li></p>
<li>Software Craftsmanship - sparked off by <a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/opinion/news/article.cfm?c_id=466&amp;objectid=10593105&amp;pnum=0">this article in the Herald</a> - general consensus was we&nbsp;didn't agree at all with the article, and that there is an&nbsp;obvious disconnect between the view points of academia and&nbsp;practicing developers.</li>
<li style="list-style: none; display: inline;">
<ul>
<li>Discussed the ideas of Science based engineering rigueur<br />
improving software quality and stopping projects running over<br />
budget, and it's rather short-sighted view of how software<br />
defects originate / what contributes to overall "software<br />
quality".</li></p>
<li>Big discussion was around Software "engineering" - and<br />
how far removed from other engineering disciplines we are.</li></p>
<li>Discussed fact that most software development focused<br />
degrees in New Zealand don't qualify you to join <a href="http://www.ipenz.org.nz/ipenz/">IPENZ</a> - and if we could,<br />
most of us wouldn't want to.</li></p>
<li>Discussed the laughable Idea of forcing developers to<br />
study something every year to "stay current" - everyone<br />
agreed if you're not learning something every <span style="text-decoration: underline;">day</span> as a developer, your<br />
doing it wrong.</li><br />
</ul><br />
</li></p>
<li>Service Buses &amp; IoC Containers (the conversation got a&nbsp;bit mixed up between these two) - things we discussed were:</li>
<li style="list-style: none; display: inline;">
<ul>
<li>When to adopt, i.e. how big does a project have to be,&nbsp;what problems should you be facing.</li>
<li>Quite a bit of discussion around the misnomer of "how&nbsp;big" being a reason to adopt any technology, rather then how&nbsp;complex, good fit etc.</li>
<li>Discussed the dangers of adopting technology and&nbsp;practices prematurely.</li>
<li>Examples of .Net service bus:</li>
<li style="list-style: none; display: inline;">
<ul>
<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/masstransit/">Mass&nbsp;Transit</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.nservicebus.com/">NServiceBus</a>.</li><br />
</ul><br />
</li><br />
</ul><br />
</li></p>
<li>Discussed the .Net Mailing List - Josh didn't know what it&nbsp;was, which in some way reflects that it's not longer promoted any&nbsp;more, discussed it succumbing to a slow death, how stack overflow&nbsp;affected question traffic etc. - FYI You can still subscribe to&nbsp;the dot.net.nz mailing lists <a href="http://www.dot.net.nz/GeneralPages/TempMailingLists.aspx?PageView=Shared">here</a>.</li>
<li>Expressed annoyance that <a href="http://dot.net.nz/">dot.net.nz</a> no longer works after the&nbsp;"upgrade" to sharepoint, need the www. prefix.</li>
<li>Wordpress twitter-like themes/plugins, such as the <a href="http://p2theme.com/">prologue / P2</a> theme.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/">Pomodoro</a>&nbsp;timers, including tomatoes, footballs, iphone apps and even&nbsp;*gasp horror* on-screen timers.</li><br />
</ul></p>
