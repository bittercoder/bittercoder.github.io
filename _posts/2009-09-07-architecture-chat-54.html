<p>Good turn out at the last Architecture chat, including Guy, who&nbsp;hadn't been to one for over a year, and Murray, a new comer.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http:&#47;&#47;secunia.com&#47;">Secunia<&#47;a> Corporate Software&nbsp;Scanner - How to identify missing patches etc.<&#47;li>
<li>Discussed the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;97-things.near-time.net&#47;wiki">97 things every software architect should know<&#47;a> and <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;Beautiful-Architecture-Leading-Thinkers-Software&#47;dp&#47;059651798X">Beautiful Architecture<&#47;a> books - I'll bring them along next&nbsp;time if anyone wants to borrow them.<&#47;li>
<li>Discussed Facebook's key&#47;value database <a href="%20http:&#47;&#47;incubator.apache.org&#47;cassandra&#47;">Cassandra<&#47;a>.<&#47;li>
<li>Discussed approaches for publishing and consuming RSS, talked&nbsp;about <a href="http:&#47;&#47;code.google.com&#47;p&#47;pubsubhubbub&#47;">PubSub&nbsp;Hubbub<&#47;a>.<&#47;li>
<li>Discussed selecting technologies for building CRUD Apps, and&nbsp;what are good technologies for learning ORM.<&#47;li>
<li style="list-style: none; display: inline;">
<ul>
<li>Discussed <a href="https:&#47;&#47;www.hibernate.org&#47;343.html">NHibernate<&#47;a> being the&nbsp;Swiss army knife, lots of features, interesting place to&nbsp;learn as you will become aware with almost every facet of ORM&nbsp;nomenclature etc.<&#47;li>
<li style="list-style: none; display: inline;">
<ul>
<li>Discussed <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.summerofnhibernate.com&#47;">Summer of&nbsp;NHibernate<&#47;a> series of screen casts &#47; tutorials.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
<&#47;li></p>
<li>Discussed <a href="http:&#47;&#47;blogs.msdn.com&#47;adonet&#47;archive&#47;tags&#47;Entity+Framework&#47;default.aspx"> Entity Framework<&#47;a>, <a href="http:&#47;&#47;msdn.microsoft.com&#47;en-us&#47;library&#47;bb386976.aspx">Linq2Sql<&#47;a>&nbsp;&nbsp;and others including <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.mindscape.co.nz&#47;products&#47;lightspeed&#47;">Lightspeed<&#47;a>.<&#47;li>
<li>Discussed difference between highly opinionated vs.&nbsp;non-opinionated ORM's.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
<&#47;li></p>
<li>Software Craftsmanship - sparked off by <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.nzherald.co.nz&#47;opinion&#47;news&#47;article.cfm?c_id=466&amp;objectid=10593105&amp;pnum=0">this article in the Herald<&#47;a> - general consensus was we&nbsp;didn't agree at all with the article, and that there is an&nbsp;obvious disconnect between the view points of academia and&nbsp;practicing developers.<&#47;li>
<li style="list-style: none; display: inline;">
<ul>
<li>Discussed the ideas of Science based engineering rigueur<br />
improving software quality and stopping projects running over<br />
budget, and it's rather short-sighted view of how software<br />
defects originate &#47; what contributes to overall "software<br />
quality".<&#47;li></p>
<li>Big discussion was around Software "engineering" - and<br />
how far removed from other engineering disciplines we are.<&#47;li></p>
<li>Discussed fact that most software development focused<br />
degrees in New Zealand don't qualify you to join <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.ipenz.org.nz&#47;ipenz&#47;">IPENZ<&#47;a> - and if we could,<br />
most of us wouldn't want to.<&#47;li></p>
<li>Discussed the laughable Idea of forcing developers to<br />
study something every year to "stay current" - everyone<br />
agreed if you're not learning something every <span style="text-decoration: underline;">day<&#47;span> as a developer, your<br />
doing it wrong.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
<&#47;li></p>
<li>Service Buses &amp; IoC Containers (the conversation got a&nbsp;bit mixed up between these two) - things we discussed were:<&#47;li>
<li style="list-style: none; display: inline;">
<ul>
<li>When to adopt, i.e. how big does a project have to be,&nbsp;what problems should you be facing.<&#47;li>
<li>Quite a bit of discussion around the misnomer of "how&nbsp;big" being a reason to adopt any technology, rather then how&nbsp;complex, good fit etc.<&#47;li>
<li>Discussed the dangers of adopting technology and&nbsp;practices prematurely.<&#47;li>
<li>Examples of .Net service bus:<&#47;li>
<li style="list-style: none; display: inline;">
<ul>
<li><a href="http:&#47;&#47;code.google.com&#47;p&#47;masstransit&#47;">Mass&nbsp;Transit<&#47;a>.<&#47;li>
<li><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.nservicebus.com&#47;">NServiceBus<&#47;a>.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
<&#47;li></p>
<li>Discussed the .Net Mailing List - Josh didn't know what it&nbsp;was, which in some way reflects that it's not longer promoted any&nbsp;more, discussed it succumbing to a slow death, how stack overflow&nbsp;affected question traffic etc. - FYI You can still subscribe to&nbsp;the dot.net.nz mailing lists <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.dot.net.nz&#47;GeneralPages&#47;TempMailingLists.aspx?PageView=Shared">here<&#47;a>.<&#47;li>
<li>Expressed annoyance that <a href="http:&#47;&#47;dot.net.nz&#47;">dot.net.nz<&#47;a> no longer works after the&nbsp;"upgrade" to sharepoint, need the www. prefix.<&#47;li>
<li>Wordpress twitter-like themes&#47;plugins, such as the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;p2theme.com&#47;">prologue &#47; P2<&#47;a> theme.<&#47;li>
<li><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.pomodorotechnique.com&#47;">Pomodoro<&#47;a>&nbsp;timers, including tomatoes, footballs, iphone apps and even&nbsp;*gasp horror* on-screen timers.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul></p>
