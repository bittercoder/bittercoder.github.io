    Hi all, sorry I didn't reply sooner.

    Heading home to NZ today - wasn't really in London long enough to justify a geek-meet, too much to see and do with Renee and other Family - but I'll be sure to give some notice next time I'm in the UK (or anywhere else in the world) to try and organize a few pints with whoever is local.

<p>So just a short note to say that I got married on the 23rd of Feb<br />
to the love of my life Renee... a good time was had by all, even<br />
though the weather was <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/4411218a10.html">horrific</a> (rained<br />
non-stop for 2 days) - big thanks to Ben, Nick, Stu, Sacha (my<br />
Entourage) and everyone else for helping with the last minute<br />
re-organisations :)</p>
<p>I'm now on honeymoon in Europe... currently lurking in Rome for a<br />
few days to take in the local sights - however we'll be making our<br />
way to England soon to catch up with some family.</p>
<p>For anyone curious about the Architecture Chat, it'll start up<br />
again in April once I'm back in New Zealand and my life has<br />
returned to some semblance of normality.</p>
