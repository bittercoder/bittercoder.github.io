    My first experience actually wasn't bad :) I managed to navigate to a location, then clicked on it to get "driving directions to here" and just typed in the start location in a little textbox hovering over the destination, it auto-completed (quickly) and returned the results quickly too - map printing was stupid though... I zoomed in a bit on what I wanted, then hit print and it just output the original zoomed-out map to the printer... hardly intuitive!

    I ended up having to use the snipping tool to print the map I was actually looking at... *joy* ;o)
