<p>The fortnightly Architecture chat is tomorrow (23<sup>rd&nbsp;</sup>October) - 11:30am at Garrisons in Sylvia Park.</p>
<p>This week I'm going to leave it very open - some quick thoughts on&nbsp;possible things we could talk about include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Silverlight 2 <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2008/10/14/silverlight-2-released.aspx">RTM released</a>.</li>
<li>ASP.Net MVC <a href="http://haacked.com/archive/2008/10/16/aspnetmvc-beta-release.aspx">Beta Released</a>.</li>
<li>Building design/graphing/modelling tools with WPF and&nbsp;competing technologies.</li>
<li>The current financial situation/outlook and it's effect on&nbsp;Start-ups, SaaS etc. - which ideas have merit, what untapped&nbsp;markets offer revenue potentials and the harsher&nbsp;criteria&nbsp;being&nbsp;applied to new ideas (ie. ability to provide imediate cost<br>
savings).</li><br>
</ul><br>
If anyone else has any suggestions feel free to leave a&nbsp;comment or message/email it to me directly, otherwise I'll see you&nbsp;all there tomorrow.
<p>Links to write-ups for previous chats, and information on the&nbsp;location etc. can be found on the <a href="http://wiki.bittercoder.com/SylviaParkArchitectureChats.ashx">wiki</a>.</p>
