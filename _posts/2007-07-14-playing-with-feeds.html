<div style="text-align: left;">I decided to have a play with some of the new aggregation-esque&nbsp;platforms this evening... for a break from cutting code...So first off I had a play with <a href="http://www.dapper.net/">dapper</a>, turning the castle project's&nbsp;build feed (that's html) into an <a href="http://www.dapper.net/services/CastleProjectBuilds">RSS</a>&nbsp;Feed... It was painless, and required zero skill ... but it was&nbsp;limited in what it was capable of achieving... basically you can&nbsp;just just click on the content you want, give it a name, then&nbsp;pick which named parts will make up say an RSS feed.
<p><img src="http://blog.bittercoder.com/images/aggregations/dapper.png" alt="dapper.png" width="798" height="544" border="1"></p>
<p>It's pretty elegant at what it does, though I think it's got a&nbsp;way to go before it'll parse some of the more tricky content out&nbsp;there.</p>
<p>The next thing I did was to have a go with <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/">yahoo pipes</a>... I decided to do&nbsp;something pretty simplistic, aggregating the feeds from the&nbsp;Fisheye change log RSS for the castle proejct with the feed I'd&nbsp;created with dapper.net for builds.... this was a delightful drag&nbsp;and drop experience, I didn't even read a tutorial ... I just&nbsp;seems to "work" exactly as you would expect.</p>
<p>The resulting published pipe is <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.run?_id=Ok934vgx3BGjLN89YEsBXw&amp;_render=rss">here</a>.</p>
<p><img src="http://blog.bittercoder.com/images/aggregations/yahoo_pipes.png" alt="yahoo_pipes.png" width="833" height="641" border="0"></p>
<p>I didn't originally have the truncate step in the pipe, but had&nbsp;to add it after attempting to burn the feed with feedburner (it&nbsp;was over 512K in size, so feedburner politely said "no") after&nbsp;that it burnt just fine... as you can see:</p>
<p><img src="http://blog.bittercoder.com/images/aggregations/feedburner.png" alt="feedburner.png" width="714" height="581" border="1"></p>
<p>I couldn't get the two aggregate feeds to sort correctly, but I'm&nbsp;sure it's possible using yahoo pipe's, any new events should&nbsp;appear in the expected order though... you can subscribe to the&nbsp;<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/CastleProjectEvents">feed</a> here&nbsp;if your curious.</p>
<p>Of course the hosted platforms aren't much use if you need to&nbsp;handle private/local feeds or interact with other types of&nbsp;systems (like your private gmail account) and that's where I&nbsp;believe something like <a href="http://plagger.org/">plagger</a>&nbsp;comes into it's own... I haven't had a chance to play with it&nbsp;yet, but it's definitely on my list of things to do... there's&nbsp;still a lot of manual information management and&nbsp;categorization/organization that I'd rather hand over to some&nbsp;kind of automated agent.</p>
<p>[Disclaimer: I'm no expert on these kinds of things, I just&nbsp;figured there might be some other "head-in-the-sand" developers&nbsp;who haven't played with these kinds of sites, and might find it&nbsp;interesting like I did ;o]</p>
