    Hey...

    What happened? I'm waiting to hear!
---
<p>Just a quick announcement.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://wiki.bittercoder.com/SylviaParkArchitectureChats.ashx">Architecture&nbsp;chat</a> is tomorrow, 11:30am at the <a href="http://www.garrisonpub.co.nz/default.aspx">usual spot</a>... some&nbsp;possible topics for discussion.</p>
<ul>
<li>AOP - Who's doing it day to day, and what tools are available&nbsp;out there for it, partly sparked by my belated look at <a href="http://blog.bittercoder.com/PermaLink,guid,759e39df-7551-458d-ba13-8916d33ed821.aspx">PostSharp</a>.</li>
<li>Sharepoint - yes I'm still on it, and unlike <a href="http://jonesie.net.nz/ILoveSharepoint.aspx">Peter Jones</a> I'm&nbsp;still not loving it all that much (though I don't have the&nbsp;luxuary of MOSS and it's additional features).</li>
<li><a href="http://www.monodevelop.com/Main_Page">MonoDevelop</a>&nbsp;is finally <a href="http://foodformonkeys.blogspot.com/2007/10/monodevelop-beta-1.html">in beta</a> - Mono is looking more and more attractive as an&nbsp;alternative, but I'm still unsure I could survive without&nbsp;resharper.</li>
<li>Windows 2008 RC is out &amp; Vista SP1 (for select people) -&nbsp;anyone played with them yet?</li><br />
</ul><br />
If anyone else has any topic suggestions then let me know,&nbsp;otherwise it'll just be an open discussion - much like every other&nbsp;time :)</p>
<p>See you there!</p>
