    Hey...

    What happened? I'm waiting to hear!
---
<p>Just a quick announcement.</p>
<p>The <a href="http:&#47;&#47;wiki.bittercoder.com&#47;SylviaParkArchitectureChats.ashx">Architecture&nbsp;chat<&#47;a> is tomorrow, 11:30am at the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.garrisonpub.co.nz&#47;default.aspx">usual spot<&#47;a>... some&nbsp;possible topics for discussion.</p>
<ul>
<li>AOP - Who's doing it day to day, and what tools are available&nbsp;out there for it, partly sparked by my belated look at <a href="http:&#47;&#47;blog.bittercoder.com&#47;PermaLink,guid,759e39df-7551-458d-ba13-8916d33ed821.aspx">PostSharp<&#47;a>.<&#47;li>
<li>Sharepoint - yes I'm still on it, and unlike <a href="http:&#47;&#47;jonesie.net.nz&#47;ILoveSharepoint.aspx">Peter Jones<&#47;a> I'm&nbsp;still not loving it all that much (though I don't have the&nbsp;luxuary of MOSS and it's additional features).<&#47;li>
<li><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.monodevelop.com&#47;Main_Page">MonoDevelop<&#47;a>&nbsp;is finally <a href="http:&#47;&#47;foodformonkeys.blogspot.com&#47;2007&#47;10&#47;monodevelop-beta-1.html">in beta<&#47;a> - Mono is looking more and more attractive as an&nbsp;alternative, but I'm still unsure I could survive without&nbsp;resharper.<&#47;li>
<li>Windows 2008 RC is out &amp; Vista SP1 (for select people) -&nbsp;anyone played with them yet?<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
If anyone else has any topic suggestions then let me know,&nbsp;otherwise it'll just be an open discussion - much like every other&nbsp;time :)</p>
<p>See you there!</p>
