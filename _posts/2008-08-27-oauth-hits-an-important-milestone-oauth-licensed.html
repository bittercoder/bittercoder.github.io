<p>It's been a back and forth discussion on the OAuth list for a while&nbsp;now - and with some people (zealots? ;o) having ideas they weren't&nbsp;even willing to contribute to the OAuth group until the IPR was&nbsp;sorted I'm glad to finally see it's been completed, this should&nbsp;hopefully help to improve the longevity and adoption of the&nbsp;standard by some who have been fence sitting.</p>
<p>So what's happened?</p>
<p>Well all all parties involved in building the original spec have&nbsp;signed an agreement of non-assertion, so now OAuth can be safely&nbsp;implemented anywhere without concern about lawsuits related to the&nbsp;IP in the spec.</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;oauth.net&#47;">OAuth<&#47;a> is a pretty elementary&nbsp;standard in it's version 1 state - so in some ways it was<br />
inevitable that this would happen (or at least I thought so) -&nbsp;there wasn't much to gain by any of the contributors blocking the&nbsp;progress of it becoming an open standard - but it's involved a lot&nbsp;of work to get it there by all accounts, so full credit goes to all<br />
involved!</p>
<p>For a detailed writeup check out the post from <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.hueniverse.com&#47;hueniverse&#47;2008&#47;08&#47;oauth-licensed.html">Eran&nbsp;Hammer-Lahav<&#47;a> or the post on <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.readwriteweb.com&#47;archives&#47;oauth_nonassert.php">Read&#47;write&nbsp;web<&#47;a>.</p>
<p>Conspicuous by it's absence is Microsoft, but for no other reason&nbsp;than they did not contribute to the OAuth standard - and so didn't&nbsp;have to sign - but of course <a href="http:&#47;&#47;dev.live.com&#47;liveid&#47;">LiveId<&#47;a> does tackle <a href="http:&#47;&#47;msdn.microsoft.com&#47;en-us&#47;library&#47;cc287637.aspx">delegated&nbsp;authentication<&#47;a> - so in some ways they have a competing platform&nbsp;for handling delegation, presumably because OAuth doesn't provide a&nbsp;rich enough set of features at this stage to handle some of the&nbsp;more complex scenarios around scalability, signing message bodies&nbsp;etc. - though I'm just hazarding a guess, LiveId was <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.hueniverse.com&#47;hueniverse&#47;2008&#47;06&#47;i-can-has-open.html">presented<br />
at the OAuth summit<&#47;a> earlier this year.</p>
