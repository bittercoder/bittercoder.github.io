<p>After a general catch-up on what everyone's doing and introductions&nbsp;from a graduate new comer (Nick Irvine) - we launched in talking&nbsp;about robotics including:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.massey.ac.nz/massey/about-us/news/article.cfm?mnarticle=leader-of-the-pick-30-04-2008">Automated Kiwifruit picking</a> robots.</li>
<li>Fruit laser bar coding and it's lack of uptake so far.</li>
<li>The possibility of per-ordered fruit i.e. you identify how&nbsp;you want your fruit, and it's picked at the precise moment when&nbsp;it fits the consumers needs.</li>
<li>The user of heuristic markings for fingerprinting of&nbsp;individual fruit (ie. the Idea that nature, by design, provides&nbsp;unique identifier for each piece of fruit, or that we could mark&nbsp;a fruit for identification that wasn't detectable/displeasing to&nbsp;the human eye.</li>
<li>Smart cars, self navigating cars, convoy or drafting&nbsp;applications for self-navigating cars and how these systems would&nbsp;deal with disconnections or extraordinary circumstances.</li><br />
</ul><br />
As an offshoot of self driving cars peter talked a little bit&nbsp;about Scribe (or&nbsp;<a>livescribe</a> - pens that record what you write and say - in&nbsp;unison - and allow playback or online publishing ) - and the future&nbsp;of pen based capture devices and note taking ie. <a href="http://www.evernote.com/?gclid=CLbKipfDopYCFRX5egodOzaCvA">evernote</a>&nbsp;etc.</p>
<p>We talked around <a href="http://hammett.castleproject.org/?p=323">Multi-dimensional&nbsp;separation of concerns</a>, and the idea of having both distinct&nbsp;dimensions (that may not be based on a single physical AOP&nbsp;approach) and modules of concerns, and the&nbsp;challenges/opportunities/solutions these "hypermodules" could&nbsp;provide to every day business problems - this also hi lighted the&nbsp;pitfalls of existing AOP approaches which often let you assemble&nbsp;incompatible/incorrect sets of concerns, which modules could help&nbsp;prevent...</p>
<p>I talked briefly around REST and the concept of a generic RESTful&nbsp;application development platform that I've been prototyping lately&nbsp;(like <a href="http://wiki.developer.mindtouch.com/Dream">dream</a>, but a little&nbsp;more resource and query oriented, and of course with OAuth support&nbsp;OOTB) rather then re purposing an MVC framework or using WCF (which&nbsp;also feels like a bad fit) or ADO.Net Data Services.</p>
<p>Last of all we talked about <a href="http://code.google.com/p/masstransit/">Mass Transit</a> just as we&nbsp;were breaking up - <a href="http://www.jamiepenney.co.nz/">Jamie</a> noted he'd been working&nbsp;on a similar project (but for java?) while at Auckland Uni. &nbsp;Perhaps I'll have a more in-depth report on it next time as I'm&nbsp;currently experimenting with it at the moment when I get&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>Thanks all for coming - write-up's of the previous chats can be&nbsp;found on the <a href="http://wiki.bittercoder.com/SylviaParkArchitectureChats.ashx">wiki</a>.</p>
