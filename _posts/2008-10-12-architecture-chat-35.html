<p>After a general catch-up on what everyone's doing and introductions&nbsp;from a graduate new comer (Nick Irvine) - we launched in talking&nbsp;about robotics including:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.massey.ac.nz&#47;massey&#47;about-us&#47;news&#47;article.cfm?mnarticle=leader-of-the-pick-30-04-2008">Automated Kiwifruit picking<&#47;a> robots.<&#47;li>
<li>Fruit laser bar coding and it's lack of uptake so far.<&#47;li>
<li>The possibility of per-ordered fruit i.e. you identify how&nbsp;you want your fruit, and it's picked at the precise moment when&nbsp;it fits the consumers needs.<&#47;li>
<li>The user of heuristic markings for fingerprinting of&nbsp;individual fruit (ie. the Idea that nature, by design, provides&nbsp;unique identifier for each piece of fruit, or that we could mark&nbsp;a fruit for identification that wasn't detectable&#47;displeasing to&nbsp;the human eye.<&#47;li>
<li>Smart cars, self navigating cars, convoy or drafting&nbsp;applications for self-navigating cars and how these systems would&nbsp;deal with disconnections or extraordinary circumstances.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
As an offshoot of self driving cars peter talked a little bit&nbsp;about Scribe (or&nbsp;<a>livescribe<&#47;a> - pens that record what you write and say - in&nbsp;unison - and allow playback or online publishing ) - and the future&nbsp;of pen based capture devices and note taking ie. <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.evernote.com&#47;?gclid=CLbKipfDopYCFRX5egodOzaCvA">evernote<&#47;a>&nbsp;etc.</p>
<p>We talked around <a href="http:&#47;&#47;hammett.castleproject.org&#47;?p=323">Multi-dimensional&nbsp;separation of concerns<&#47;a>, and the idea of having both distinct&nbsp;dimensions (that may not be based on a single physical AOP&nbsp;approach) and modules of concerns, and the&nbsp;challenges&#47;opportunities&#47;solutions these "hypermodules" could&nbsp;provide to every day business problems - this also hi lighted the&nbsp;pitfalls of existing AOP approaches which often let you assemble&nbsp;incompatible&#47;incorrect sets of concerns, which modules could help&nbsp;prevent...</p>
<p>I talked briefly around REST and the concept of a generic RESTful&nbsp;application development platform that I've been prototyping lately&nbsp;(like <a href="http:&#47;&#47;wiki.developer.mindtouch.com&#47;Dream">dream<&#47;a>, but a little&nbsp;more resource and query oriented, and of course with OAuth support&nbsp;OOTB) rather then re purposing an MVC framework or using WCF (which&nbsp;also feels like a bad fit) or ADO.Net Data Services.</p>
<p>Last of all we talked about <a href="http:&#47;&#47;code.google.com&#47;p&#47;masstransit&#47;">Mass Transit<&#47;a> just as we&nbsp;were breaking up - <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.jamiepenney.co.nz&#47;">Jamie<&#47;a> noted he'd been working&nbsp;on a similar project (but for java?) while at Auckland Uni. &nbsp;Perhaps I'll have a more in-depth report on it next time as I'm&nbsp;currently experimenting with it at the moment when I get&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>Thanks all for coming - write-up's of the previous chats can be&nbsp;found on the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;wiki.bittercoder.com&#47;SylviaParkArchitectureChats.ashx">wiki<&#47;a>.</p>
