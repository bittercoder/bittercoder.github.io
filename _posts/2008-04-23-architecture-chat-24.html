<p>Good turn-out for the Architecture chat last week... thanks for&nbsp;coming along all (I believe there was 8 of us)</p>
<p>What we talked about:</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.jabber.org&#47;">Jabber<&#47;a> &#47; <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.xmpp.org&#47;">XMPP<&#47;a> got a brief mention - as I'm&nbsp;currently investigating it for some side-projects as a scalable way&nbsp;to interact with a cloud of servers&#47;devices... but nobody else had&nbsp;much interest&#47;experience so we moved on.</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;weblogs.asp.net&#47;scottgu&#47;archive&#47;2008&#47;02&#47;22&#47;first-look-at-silverlight-2.aspx"><br />
Silverlight 2.0<&#47;a> beta's - talked briefly about beta 1 and&nbsp;upcoming beta 2 - including <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.hanselman.com&#47;blog&#47;DeepZoomSeadragonSilverlight2MultiScaleImagesAtMix.aspx"><br />
Deep Zoom<&#47;a> and the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;visitmix.com&#47;blogs&#47;News&#47;NBC&#47;">NBC Olympics<&#47;a> silverlight&nbsp;player which looks to deliver a better experience then TV ever&nbsp;could.</p>
<p>We also had an in-depth discussion around the woes of working&nbsp;with&#47;without app-domains and loading and unloading assemblies from&nbsp;either disk or byte arrays into the current app domain, security&nbsp;implications etc.</p>
<p>Bunch of points were made, and it was a pretty interesting&nbsp;discussion:</p>
<ul>
<li>Briefly discussed <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.mono-project.com&#47;Cecil">Cecil<&#47;a> - The swiss army&nbsp;knife of IL :)<&#47;li>
<li><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.postsharp.org&#47;">PostSharp<&#47;a> - which&nbsp;provides an interesting tool set for implementing AOP and other&nbsp;concepts (such as <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.codeplex.com&#47;NetSTM">software transactional&nbsp;memory<&#47;a>).<&#47;li>
<li>Garbage collection of types.<&#47;li>
<li>.Net Framework 3.5 <a href="http:&#47;&#47;msdn2.microsoft.com&#47;en-us&#47;library&#47;system.addin.aspx">add-in<&#47;a>&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;msdn2.microsoft.com&#47;en-us&#47;library&#47;system.addin.aspx">system<&#47;a> (System.AddIn &amp; System.AddIn.Contract) - we also&nbsp;posed the question, can it run without the 3.5 framework<&#47;li>
<li>installed - a quick reverse engineer and compile via .Net&nbsp;reflector in VS2005 suggests that yes, yes it can work quite well&nbsp;without the rest of the the 3.5 libraries.<&#47;li>
<li>Altering IL at run-time, and the ruby-like concepts of a&nbsp;class is "never done" down to the concept of being able to break&nbsp;apart a routine at runtime and alter the IL, and where JIT'ing&nbsp;fits into the life cycle of IL and Execution.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
Automatic unit test generation got a mention - I had a total&nbsp;mind blank and couldn't remember the name of the product (which we&nbsp;have discussed in the past) - which of course was <a href="http:&#47;&#47;research.microsoft.com&#47;pex&#47;">pex<&#47;a>... Sadly still no&nbsp;public beta for us to try yet!</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;aws.typepad.com&#47;aws&#47;">Amazon web services<&#47;a> - we&nbsp;discussed the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;gp&#47;browse.html?node=342429011">dev pay&nbsp;limited beta<&#47;a> (takes the pain out of dealing with&nbsp;customers&#47;billing when developing apps for <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;EC2-AWS-Service-Pricing&#47;b&#47;ref=sc_fe_c_0_342429011_2?ie=UTF8&amp;node=201590011&amp;no=342429011&amp;me=A36L942TSJ2AJA"><br />
EC2<&#47;a>&#47;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;S3-AWS-home-page-Money&#47;b&#47;ref=sc_fe_c_0_342429011_1?ie=UTF8&amp;node=16427261&amp;no=342429011&amp;me=A36L942TSJ2AJA">S3<&#47;a>)&nbsp;- this included discussing the development of applications for the&nbsp;"cloud" and what opportunities exist when leveraging the Amazon&nbsp;services, including the recently added support for <a href="http:&#47;&#47;aws.typepad.com&#47;aws&#47;2008&#47;04&#47;block-to-the-fu.html">persistent&nbsp;local disks<&#47;a> to the EC2 platform.</p>
<p>Also in relation to EC2 we discussed writing apps for EC2 using&nbsp;C#&#47;Mono - this led to a discussion on the state of Mono, i.e. where&nbsp;it's .Net 3.5 support is at and if&#47;when WPF might be ported to&nbsp;Mono.</p>
<p>Thanks for all coming along, the next meeting is slated to be next&nbsp;Thursday, May 1st.</p>
