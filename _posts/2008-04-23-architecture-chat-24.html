<p>Good turn-out for the Architecture chat last week... thanks for&nbsp;coming along all (I believe there was 8 of us)</p>
<p>What we talked about:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jabber.org/">Jabber</a> / <a href="http://www.xmpp.org/">XMPP</a> got a brief mention - as I'm&nbsp;currently investigating it for some side-projects as a scalable way&nbsp;to interact with a cloud of servers/devices... but nobody else had&nbsp;much interest/experience so we moved on.</p>
<p><a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2008/02/22/first-look-at-silverlight-2.aspx"><br />
Silverlight 2.0</a> beta's - talked briefly about beta 1 and&nbsp;upcoming beta 2 - including <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/DeepZoomSeadragonSilverlight2MultiScaleImagesAtMix.aspx"><br />
Deep Zoom</a> and the <a href="http://visitmix.com/blogs/News/NBC/">NBC Olympics</a> silverlight&nbsp;player which looks to deliver a better experience then TV ever&nbsp;could.</p>
<p>We also had an in-depth discussion around the woes of working&nbsp;with/without app-domains and loading and unloading assemblies from&nbsp;either disk or byte arrays into the current app domain, security&nbsp;implications etc.</p>
<p>Bunch of points were made, and it was a pretty interesting&nbsp;discussion:</p>
<ul>
<li>Briefly discussed <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Cecil">Cecil</a> - The swiss army&nbsp;knife of IL :)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.postsharp.org/">PostSharp</a> - which&nbsp;provides an interesting tool set for implementing AOP and other&nbsp;concepts (such as <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/NetSTM">software transactional&nbsp;memory</a>).</li>
<li>Garbage collection of types.</li>
<li>.Net Framework 3.5 <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.addin.aspx">add-in</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.addin.aspx">system</a> (System.AddIn &amp; System.AddIn.Contract) - we also&nbsp;posed the question, can it run without the 3.5 framework</li>
<li>installed - a quick reverse engineer and compile via .Net&nbsp;reflector in VS2005 suggests that yes, yes it can work quite well&nbsp;without the rest of the the 3.5 libraries.</li>
<li>Altering IL at run-time, and the ruby-like concepts of a&nbsp;class is "never done" down to the concept of being able to break&nbsp;apart a routine at runtime and alter the IL, and where JIT'ing&nbsp;fits into the life cycle of IL and Execution.</li><br />
</ul><br />
Automatic unit test generation got a mention - I had a total&nbsp;mind blank and couldn't remember the name of the product (which we&nbsp;have discussed in the past) - which of course was <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/pex/">pex</a>... Sadly still no&nbsp;public beta for us to try yet!</p>
<p><a href="http://aws.typepad.com/aws/">Amazon web services</a> - we&nbsp;discussed the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html?node=342429011">dev pay&nbsp;limited beta</a> (takes the pain out of dealing with&nbsp;customers/billing when developing apps for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/EC2-AWS-Service-Pricing/b/ref=sc_fe_c_0_342429011_2?ie=UTF8&amp;node=201590011&amp;no=342429011&amp;me=A36L942TSJ2AJA"><br />
EC2</a>/<a href="http://www.amazon.com/S3-AWS-home-page-Money/b/ref=sc_fe_c_0_342429011_1?ie=UTF8&amp;node=16427261&amp;no=342429011&amp;me=A36L942TSJ2AJA">S3</a>)&nbsp;- this included discussing the development of applications for the&nbsp;"cloud" and what opportunities exist when leveraging the Amazon&nbsp;services, including the recently added support for <a href="http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2008/04/block-to-the-fu.html">persistent&nbsp;local disks</a> to the EC2 platform.</p>
<p>Also in relation to EC2 we discussed writing apps for EC2 using&nbsp;C#/Mono - this led to a discussion on the state of Mono, i.e. where&nbsp;it's .Net 3.5 support is at and if/when WPF might be ported to&nbsp;Mono.</p>
<p>Thanks for all coming along, the next meeting is slated to be next&nbsp;Thursday, May 1st.</p>
