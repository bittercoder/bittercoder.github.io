<p>So the &nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;blogs.msdn.com&#47;darrylburling&#47;archive&#47;2008&#47;02&#47;04&#47;auckland-done-coming-your-way-soon.aspx">sun has set<&#47;a> on day 1 of the Summer Road Trip 2008 in Auckland -&nbsp;The Presentation was done by <a href="http:&#47;&#47;turtle.net.nz&#47;blog">JB<&#47;a>, <a href="http:&#47;&#47;syringe.net.nz&#47;">Chris<&#47;a> and Myself this afternoon - it&nbsp;went very well, people enjoyed the content and the mix of&nbsp;integration, server management, database and development topics&nbsp;really meshed together nicely I thought...</p>
<p>There was enough to keep everyone interested, regardless of the hat&nbsp;you wear - and plenty of prizes too - well all love swag&nbsp;right?!</p>
<p>Big thanks to our MC <a href="http:&#47;&#47;dev-for-fun.blogspot.com&#47;">Jaqcui<&#47;a>, who handled the&nbsp;Intro and Outro and let everyone know about the local <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.ellerslieusergroup.net.nz&#47;">Ellerslie<&#47;a> &amp;&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.dot.net.nz&#47;Default.aspx?tabid=29">Central&nbsp;Auckland<&#47;a> user group's - where I'll be sure to run a few&nbsp;sessions later in the year... and of course <a href="http:&#47;&#47;blogs.msdn.com&#47;darrylburling&#47;default.aspx">Darryl<&#47;a> for&nbsp;handling some of the finer details like the venue, lunch, and the&nbsp;dinner afterwards - much appreciated.</p>
<p>For all those that came along - first off thanks for coming,&nbsp;obviously without participation in these events they'll just dry up&nbsp;and stop happening - and second don't forgot that there is no time&nbsp;like the present to start picking up these technologies and&nbsp;developing applications with and for them - the products are all&nbsp;but ready, so why can't you be (and not only are they great&nbsp;technologies, they're fun too).</p>
<p>The next presentation is in Tauranga - and there are still places&nbsp;left, so <a href="http:&#47;&#47;cid-00094682511176ef.events.live.com&#47;">sign up here<&#47;a> -<br />
It's going to be on tomorrow (5th of Feb) at 1:00pm I&nbsp;believe.</p>
<p>And finally a short plug ;o)</p>

<p>For anyone that found this presentation interesting and would like&nbsp;to discuss the technical details of things like emerging&nbsp;technologies, general software Architecture, Developer Tools,&nbsp;Running software businesses etc.&nbsp; I also organise the local<br />
<a href="http:&#47;&#47;wiki.bittercoder.com&#47;SylviaParkArchitectureChats.ashx">Sylvia&nbsp;Park Architecture Chat<&#47;a> - which is a pretty casual meeting of&nbsp;some very smart people in the .Net Community.</p>
<p>We normally get together on a fortnightly basis at Garrisons in&nbsp;Sylvia Park and are always keen to have more people&#47;fresh faces to&nbsp;come along and join in our discussions or even just float some&nbsp;development&#47;architecture questions or problems you might have that&nbsp;the group can help solve - keep an eye on my blog, or the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;dot.net.nz&#47;">dot.net.nz<&#47;a> mailing list for announcements&nbsp;of when we'll next be meeting up :)</p>
<p>And all are welcome of course!</p>
