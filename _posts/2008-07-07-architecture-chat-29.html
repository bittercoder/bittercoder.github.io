<p>Reasonable turnout at the last Architecture Chat - appologies about<br />
the late write-up!<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
So we talked about a few things last week - on a recurring them of<br />
IL generation and weaving we discussed verifying generated<br />
assemblies with <a href="http:&#47;&#47;msdn.microsoft.com&#47;en-us&#47;library&#47;62bwd2yd%28VS.80%29.aspx">PEVerify<&#47;a><br />
- and how to ensure IL you generate is not invalid and Garreth<br />
mentioned some issues with ILDASM crashes when using <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.mono-project.com&#47;Cecil">Mono.Cecil<&#47;a>.<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
We talked about the process for wrapping and abstracting<br />
functionality and services, and I gave a brief mention to this blog<br />
post which provides a slightly more formalized description to this<br />
process - <a href="http:&#47;&#47;hcoding.blogspot.com&#47;2008&#47;06&#47;wafagy.html">Wafagy<&#47;a>.<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
The discussion moved onto file&#47;XML persistence and substituting<br />
traditional relational databases with alternative persistence<br />
mechanisms, especially in the cloud.<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
Static analysis tools were discussed, and thoughts about what (if<br />
any) alternatives exist to tools such as <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.ndepend.com&#47;">NDepend<&#47;a>.<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
We talked about the use of "toolkit" style projects such as the<br />
<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.codeplex.com&#47;umbrella">Umbrella project<&#47;a> or<br />
<a href="http:&#47;&#47;ayende.com&#47;Wiki&#47;Default.aspx?Page=Rhino+Commons&amp;AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1"><br />
Rhino Commons<&#47;a> and the compromise often felt between plucking<br />
out only the bits you want (to control the surface area of your<br />
project) verses the wish to easily integrate updates and unit tests<br />
from the library into your project as they undergo continual<br />
improvement.<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
I also talked about hostile templating&#47;transformation languages<br />
(such as the template language in <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.sparxsystems.com.au&#47;">Enterprise Architect<&#47;a> which<br />
I've been using for a recent project) and what features make a<br />
domain or templating language "hostile" to being part of your daily<br />
process i.e. lack of debugging, lack of comment syntax, poorly<br />
identified or completely missed syntax errors, left to right<br />
expression evaluation, lack of operator presidence rules etc.<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
I then gave a quick run through how I've been using the MDA and MDG<br />
to model a PIM (platform independent model) of the domain,<br />
including OCL constraints, and how it's automatically transformed<br />
into a platform specific model (Castle <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.castleproject.org&#47;ActiveRecord&#47;">ActiveRecord<&#47;a> with<br />
<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.castleproject.org&#47;activerecord&#47;documentation&#47;v1rc1&#47;usersguide&#47;validation.html"><br />
validation attributes<&#47;a> in this case) which is then used to<br />
generate code from - and the issues I've encountered so far with<br />
the tool.<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />

The next Architecture chat is this Thursday, all are welcome.<br &#47;></p>
