<p>Reasonable turnout at the last Architecture Chat - appologies about<br />
the late write-up!<br /><br />
<br /><br />
So we talked about a few things last week - on a recurring them of<br />
IL generation and weaving we discussed verifying generated<br />
assemblies with <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/62bwd2yd%28VS.80%29.aspx">PEVerify</a><br />
- and how to ensure IL you generate is not invalid and Garreth<br />
mentioned some issues with ILDASM crashes when using <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Cecil">Mono.Cecil</a>.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
We talked about the process for wrapping and abstracting<br />
functionality and services, and I gave a brief mention to this blog<br />
post which provides a slightly more formalized description to this<br />
process - <a href="http://hcoding.blogspot.com/2008/06/wafagy.html">Wafagy</a>.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The discussion moved onto file/XML persistence and substituting<br />
traditional relational databases with alternative persistence<br />
mechanisms, especially in the cloud.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Static analysis tools were discussed, and thoughts about what (if<br />
any) alternatives exist to tools such as <a href="http://www.ndepend.com/">NDepend</a>.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
We talked about the use of "toolkit" style projects such as the<br />
<a href="http://www.codeplex.com/umbrella">Umbrella project</a> or<br />
<a href="http://ayende.com/Wiki/Default.aspx?Page=Rhino+Commons&amp;AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1"><br />
Rhino Commons</a> and the compromise often felt between plucking<br />
out only the bits you want (to control the surface area of your<br />
project) verses the wish to easily integrate updates and unit tests<br />
from the library into your project as they undergo continual<br />
improvement.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
I also talked about hostile templating/transformation languages<br />
(such as the template language in <a href="http://www.sparxsystems.com.au/">Enterprise Architect</a> which<br />
I've been using for a recent project) and what features make a<br />
domain or templating language "hostile" to being part of your daily<br />
process i.e. lack of debugging, lack of comment syntax, poorly<br />
identified or completely missed syntax errors, left to right<br />
expression evaluation, lack of operator presidence rules etc.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
I then gave a quick run through how I've been using the MDA and MDG<br />
to model a PIM (platform independent model) of the domain,<br />
including OCL constraints, and how it's automatically transformed<br />
into a platform specific model (Castle <a href="http://www.castleproject.org/ActiveRecord/">ActiveRecord</a> with<br />
<a href="http://www.castleproject.org/activerecord/documentation/v1rc1/usersguide/validation.html"><br />
validation attributes</a> in this case) which is then used to<br />
generate code from - and the issues I've encountered so far with<br />
the tool.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Details of previous chats can be found <a href="http://wiki.bittercoder.com/SylviaParkArchitectureChats.ashx">here</a><br />
on the wiki.<br /><br />

The next Architecture chat is this Thursday, all are welcome.<br /></p>
