<p>So, big congratulations to <a href="http://www.base4.net/">Alex&nbsp;J</a> - first an <a href="http://www.base4.net/Blog.aspx?ID=495">MVP</a> and now a <a href="http://www.base4.net/Blog.aspx?ID=538">Microsoft employee</a> to&nbsp;boot... (which I suspect trumps his MVP status, probably should be&nbsp;MV<strong>E</strong> now, for Employee!).</p>
<p>I've been working with Alex (2 Alex's... very confusing) on a&nbsp;pretty interesting project for the last couple of months, and it's&nbsp;been a lot of fun getting a brain dump from a guy who's so&nbsp;passionate about technology (and community too) and with so many&nbsp;varied and original ideas... Whenever Alex J starts a sentence with&nbsp;"<em>now I've been putting some thinking around this</em>" you&nbsp;generally know your about to learn something cool :)</p>
<p>On a side note, I'm thinking of taking over the&nbsp;organization/blogging etc. of the Sylvia Park Architecture Chats in&nbsp;the other Alex's absence... It would be a real shame to let it die&nbsp;once Alex J has moved to the states... at any rate, something to&nbsp;talk about this coming Thursday at the next chat!</p>
