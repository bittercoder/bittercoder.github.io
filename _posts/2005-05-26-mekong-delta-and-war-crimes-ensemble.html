  <strong>Fun on the Mekong<&#47;strong><br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>
  Well the last few days on the Mekong delta have been great -<br />
  especially yesterday as we jumped a boat to take us eastwards<br />
  down the mekong to Can Tho where we stayed in a local farm stay<br />
  (basically just somebodies house converted to allow for visitor<br />
  accomodation).&nbsp;<br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>
  The boat trip took about 8 hours, and I spent most of it a hamock<br />
  reading a book or listening to music...&nbsp;&nbsp;there is such<br />
  an abundance of things to look at! So much is going on in the<br />
  Mekong delta - I've seen brick factories, loads of family owned<br />
  live aboard cargo boats, floating fish farms (basically houses<br />
  with netting cages underneath housing the fish), barges dredging<br />
  the harbour of transporting fertilizer and all sorts of other<br />
  random things.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's definitely my favourite part of<br />
  the Mekong that I've seen so far - I'd love to come back with my<br />
  own boat and explore the region thoroughly one day - it's simply<br />
  stunning.<br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>
  This'morning we got up early and headed to the floating markets<br />
  in Can Tho by boat&nbsp;- the markets setup every morning,<br />
  selling food predominiately, but also covering things such as<br />
  porcelain, fuel and building materials - all from boats floating<br />
  50 or so yards off shore.. I would estimate that there was at<br />
  least 200 boats there this morning - fascinating stuff to watch,<br />
  especially as just about every boat over&nbsp;6 or 7&nbsp;metres<br />
  doubles as a family home.. so you have&nbsp;mum, dad&nbsp;and the<br />
  kids all helping out.. some more then others (the woman here seem<br />
  to get worked bloody hard).<br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>
  Also while in Chau Doc we headed up the Sam mountains to watch<br />
  sun set over the amazingly fertile Mekong delta (I've never seen<br />
  any place greener) - and headed out to a village near the Khmer<br />
  border which had all but 3 of it's occupants slaughtered by the<br />
  Khmer rouge - and amazingly one of the 3 survivers runs the local<br />
  drinks shop, so you can talk to her (via a translator) - what a<br />
  tough old bugger she is too - shot in the neck and beaten over<br />
  the head - she lost conciousness only to awake 3 hours later and<br />
  discover everyone else in the town dead (I think it was<br />
  aproximately 3000 killed?) - and somehow she just kept of living<br />
  ever since.<br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>
  <strong>Back to Saigon, The War Remnants museum<&#47;strong><br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>
  This afternoon we headed back to Saigon, where I am now.. and<br />
  decided to visit the war remnants museum... which is basically<br />
  the American&#47;Japanese war crimes museum.. the museum seems to be<br />
  split into 4 sections.&nbsp; The first is a number of war<br />
  artificats - including tanks, fighters, helicopters and artillery<br />
  from the vietnam war... which was quite interesting, to me at<br />
  least.. second section is a wonderful array of war time<br />
  photography done by american and japanese war correspondents that<br />
  provides an insight into the photographers themselves as opposed<br />
  to what they were capturing on film, included in this section is<br />
  a book listing a page long history of each photographer who lost<br />
  his life (or just went missing) during the conflict.. I never<br />
  realised just how many war correspondents perished in the<br />
  conflict.. there are a lot of pages.<br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>
  After that we have the war crimes sections, which I see as two -<br />
  basically the first one you hit is what generally horrifies most<br />
  people - which details the devestation caused by defoliants, such<br />
  as agent orange, and phosphor based bombs dropped on villages. If<br />
  the photos on the walls aren't bad enough (people with skin<br />
  falling off, disfigured and humongous birth defects) - they also<br />
  have fouetuses in jars showing massive deformities as a result of<br />
  gross dioxin poisoning in their mothers.<br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>
  The second section is the more traditional war crimes -<br />
  documenting the wholesale slaughter of men, woman and children..<br />
  with some truely horrific pictures of American soldiers looking<br />
  pretty pleased with themselves as they proudly show off corpses<br />
  (and in some cases partial corpses) of their victims.<br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>
  I think the museum in itself is interesting for two very<br />
  different reason, one because of the truely amazing photographs<br />
  that are on display, and secondly because it is truely a product<br />
  of propoganda fueled from the north&nbsp;- displaying a<br />
  particularly one sided view of a tragic and drawn out conflict -<br />
  a good reminder of whoever wins the war, writes the history<br />
  books... but regardless of bias, the end result is that a lot of<br />
  people died on both sides, most of them needlessly.&nbsp;<br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>
  <strong>Off The Nah Trang<&#47;strong><br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>
  Tonight we jump onto an overnight train at 11:00pm to take us up<br />
  to Nha&nbsp;Trang ... it will be interesting to see how the<br />
  trains are in Vietnam, compared to China and Thailand<br />
  -&nbsp;Looking forward to it, definitely been too long since I've<br />
  been able to catch a train (seeing as Laos has none, and Cambodia<br />
  has one or two (depending on who you talk too)&nbsp;.. but it's<br />
  only capable of travelling at ~20km&#47;hr!)<br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>
  Incidentally Nah Trang used to be the traditional R&amp;R spot<br />
  for american soldiers, and still carries a very dodgy reputation<br />
  after dark - it should be good for a laugh, though my guide<br />
  warned that they've had cases of men being chased by prostitutes<br />
  - even all the way into elevators in hotels.<br />
<&#47;p></p>
