<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.jonorossi.com&#47;">Jonathon Rossi<&#47;a> over in<br />
Brisbane has been hard at work on the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.jonorossi.com&#47;projects&#47;cvsi&#47;">CVSI project<&#47;a> (Castle<br />
Visual Studio Integration) and has released <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.jonorossi.com&#47;blog&#47;archive&#47;2008&#47;06&#47;29&#47;castle-visual-studio-integration-0.3.aspx"><br />
version 0.3<&#47;a> which now supports VS 2008 - for those not in the<br />
know CVSI provides nvelocity intellisense when writing views for<br />
monorail.<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
I did some testing of some earlier releases last week and it's<br />
looking good, hilights include:<br &#47;></p>
<ul>
<li>New installer which supports 2005 and 2008.<br />
  <&#47;li></p>
<li>Basic XHTML intelisense.<br />
  <&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul>It also includes some fixes which means the intelisense now<br />
works when the templates are not in a web application project<br />
(useful for those of us writing applications where we have<br />
pluggable modules) and fixes for multi-level inheritence, so<br />
helpers and view components with multiple levels of base class i.e.<br />
FormHelper (which now inherits from AbstractFormRelatedHelper) will<br />
be included in the list of classes, something which bugged me with<br />
earlier releases on 2005.<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
Great work Jono!<br &#47;></p>
