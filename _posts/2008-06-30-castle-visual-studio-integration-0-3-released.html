<p><a href="http://www.jonorossi.com/">Jonathon Rossi</a> over in<br>
Brisbane has been hard at work on the <a href="http://www.jonorossi.com/projects/cvsi/">CVSI project</a> (Castle<br>
Visual Studio Integration) and has released <a href="http://www.jonorossi.com/blog/archive/2008/06/29/castle-visual-studio-integration-0.3.aspx"><br>
version 0.3</a> which now supports VS 2008 - for those not in the<br>
know CVSI provides nvelocity intellisense when writing views for<br>
monorail.<br><br>
<br><br>
I did some testing of some earlier releases last week and it's<br>
looking good, hilights include:<br></p>
<ul>
<li>New installer which supports 2005 and 2008.<br>
  </li>
<li>Basic XHTML intelisense.<br>
  </li><br>
</ul>It also includes some fixes which means the intelisense now<br>
works when the templates are not in a web application project<br>
(useful for those of us writing applications where we have<br>
pluggable modules) and fixes for multi-level inheritence, so<br>
helpers and view components with multiple levels of base class i.e.<br>
FormHelper (which now inherits from AbstractFormRelatedHelper) will<br>
be included in the list of classes, something which bugged me with<br>
earlier releases on 2005.<br><br>
<br><br>
Great work Jono!<br>
