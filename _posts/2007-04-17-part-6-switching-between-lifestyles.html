    Yeah, it's a good point - generally speaking most projects leveraging Castle windsor tend to have:

    A Reference to <strong>Castle.Core</strong> for any components being registered in the container... to access interfaces such as <strong>IStartable</strong>, and attributes like <strong>[Transient]</strong>.

    And of course for the main assembly/application that instantiates the container itself they will also need a reference to the <strong>Castle.Core</strong>, <strong>Castle.MicroKernel</strong>, <strong>Castle.DynamicProxy2</strong> and <strong>Castle.Windsor</strong>.

Switching lifestyles is the theme of this post... so what's that<br />
all about?<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Well first off - what is a lifestyle, in basic terms it specifies how many instances will be available at any one time from the container - so at the one extreme we have components with a transient lifestyle, where any requests from those components will return new instances - and at the opposite end of the spectrum we have singleton components, where there is only one instance for the whole container - there are other types of lifestyle, but we'll leave those for another post.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
So first off - castle is all about convention over configuration, and by convention a component in the container is a singleton... so in this example we'll look into ways in which you can switch a components lifestyle to being transient.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
First off, heres our component:<br /><br />
<br /></p>
<pre>
public class AddingService<br />
{<br />
    private int _total = 0;</p>
<p>    public void AddAmmount(int ammount)<br />
    {<br />
        _total += ammount;<br />
    }</p>
<p>    public int Total<br />
    {<br />
        get { return _total; }<br />
    }<br />
}<br />
</pre><br /><br />
It lets us add stuff... how neat is that... lets see our program:<br /><br />
<br /></p>
<pre>
private static void Main(string[] args)<br />
{<br />
    WindsorContainer container = new WindsorContainer(new XmlInterpreter());</p>
<p>    AddingService sheepCounted = container.Resolve<AddingService>();<br />
    AddingService catsHerded = container.Resolve<AddingService>();</p>
<p>    sheepCounted.AddAmmount(10);<br />
    sheepCounted.AddAmmount(50);</p>
<p>    catsHerded.AddAmmount(3);<br />
    catsHerded.AddAmmount(12);</p>
<p>    Console.WriteLine("You have counted {0} sheep and herded {1} angry cats", sheepCounted.Total,<br />
                      catsHerded.Total);</p>
<p>    Console.Read();<br />
}<br />
</pre><br /><br />
And if we run it:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<b>You have counted 75 sheep and herded 75 angry cats</b><br /><br />
<br /><br />
That doesn't seem right - our service is retaining a count, so we want a fresh instance of the class every time we request it - which means we should shift our component to the "transient" lifestyle - lets have a go at doing it with configuration, by adding the lifestyle attribute to the components definition.<br /><br />
<br /></p>
<pre>
<configuration></p>
<p>  <configSections></p>
<section name="castle"<br />
        type="Castle.Windsor.Configuration.AppDomain.CastleSectionHandler, Castle.Windsor" /><br />
  </configSections></p>
<p>  <castle><br />
    <components><br />
      <component id="adding.service" type="IoC.Tutorials.Part6.AddingService, IoC.Tutorials.Part6" lifestyle="transient" /><br />
    </components><br />
  </castle></p>
<p></configuration><br />
</pre><br /><br />
And now if we run it again:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<b>You have counted 60 sheep and herded 15 angry cats</b><br /><br />
<br /><br />
That looks a bit better... but I propose that in many cases when your writing a component you know what it's lifestyle should be, before it's ever registered in a container - for instance in this case this class should always be transient, so we can actually decorate the class with a "Transient" attribute and can skip having to put the lifestyle in the configuration, this is how that would look:<br /><br />
<br /></p>
<pre>
[Transient]<br />
public class AddingService<br />
{<br />
    private int _total = 0;</p>
<p>    public void AddAmmount(int ammount)<br />
    {<br />
        _total += ammount;<br />
    }</p>
<p>    public int Total<br />
    {<br />
        get { return _total; }<br />
    }<br />
}<br />
</pre><br /><br />
There are other lifestyles available to use - it's worth having a look through the castle <a href="http://wiki.castleproject.org/index.php/IoC:Lifecycle_and_lifestyles"> wiki</a> for more details... and we'll probably cover them in another post.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
In the next part we will cover switching out implementations of components themselves.</p>
