    I think a screen scraper is overkill.  You can easily use the Rails console runner and some Rake tasks to do the heavy lifting:

    (trying blockquote for code since I don't see pre support)
    <blockquote>
    existing_issue = Issue.find_by_subject(incoming_exception.summary)
    if existing_issue
      # Do nothing, issue already exists.  Or maybe increment something to track how often the issue occurs
    else
      # Create a new issue from the incoming exception
      issue = Issue.create({ :subject => incoming_exception.summary, :description => incoming_exception.body...})
    end
    </blockquote>

<p>Hi all, there's an Architecture chat this Thursday - 21st August @&nbsp;11:30am onwards.</p>
<p>Some things that I've caught my eye since last time:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/products/cc533447.aspx">.Net 3.5 SP1 and VS2008 RTM are here</a></li>
<li>VS2K8SP1 and SQL2K8 installs are a big mixed bag, some people&nbsp;no problem, other tearing hair out!</li>
<li>And so are the war stories such as <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/%7Er/AyendeRahien/%7E3/365603718/Waiting-for-the-Service-Pack-I-dont-think-so.aspx">regressions</a> and <a href="http://blog.domaindotnet.com/2008/08/11/undocumented-linq-net-35-sp1-gold-forgot-to-mention-these-critical-changes-that-might-break-your-code/">critical changes</a> - doh!</li>
<li>Visibility and trouble with non-developers being unable to&nbsp;quantify the quality of developer outputs - sparked off by this&nbsp;<a href="http://devlicio.us/blogs/casey/archive/2008/08/18/software-development-is-a-creative-skill-building-houses-is-a-technical-one.aspx">post by Casey</a>.</li>
<li>Resharper 4.01 RC1 is out.</li>
<li>ASP.NET MVC now and in the future (i.e. where it's going, and&nbsp;perhaps a discussion on future of monorail vs. MVC and Monorail&nbsp;2??).</li>
<li>Security practices on MVC, WCF etc.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.redmine.org/%20">Redmine</a> - an interesting (and&nbsp;nicer) alternative to Trac - wonder if there's an easy&nbsp;transition path for existing Trac sites?</li><br>
</ul><br>
<strong>Edit</strong>: updated this list with some suggestions from&nbsp;others.
<p>If anyone has any topic suggestions - just make a post on this&nbsp;entry, or send me an email / IM message.</p>
<p>Details of previous posts and directions etc. can be found <a href="http://wiki.bittercoder.com/SylviaParkArchitectureChats.ashx">here&nbsp;on the wiki</a>.</p>
