    I think a screen scraper is overkill.  You can easily use the Rails console runner and some Rake tasks to do the heavy lifting:

    (trying blockquote for code since I don't see pre support)
    <blockquote>
    existing_issue = Issue.find_by_subject(incoming_exception.summary)
    if existing_issue
      # Do nothing, issue already exists.  Or maybe increment something to track how often the issue occurs
    else
      # Create a new issue from the incoming exception
      issue = Issue.create({ :subject => incoming_exception.summary, :description => incoming_exception.body...})
    end
    <&#47;blockquote>

<p>Hi all, there's an Architecture chat this Thursday - 21st August @&nbsp;11:30am onwards.</p>
<p>Some things that I've caught my eye since last time:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http:&#47;&#47;msdn.microsoft.com&#47;en-us&#47;vstudio&#47;products&#47;cc533447.aspx">.Net 3.5 SP1 and VS2008 RTM are here<&#47;a><&#47;li>
<li>VS2K8SP1 and SQL2K8 installs are a big mixed bag, some people&nbsp;no problem, other tearing hair out!<&#47;li>
<li>And so are the war stories such as <a href="http:&#47;&#47;feeds.feedburner.com&#47;%7Er&#47;AyendeRahien&#47;%7E3&#47;365603718&#47;Waiting-for-the-Service-Pack-I-dont-think-so.aspx">regressions<&#47;a> and <a href="http:&#47;&#47;blog.domaindotnet.com&#47;2008&#47;08&#47;11&#47;undocumented-linq-net-35-sp1-gold-forgot-to-mention-these-critical-changes-that-might-break-your-code&#47;">critical changes<&#47;a> - doh!<&#47;li>
<li>Visibility and trouble with non-developers being unable to&nbsp;quantify the quality of developer outputs - sparked off by this&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;devlicio.us&#47;blogs&#47;casey&#47;archive&#47;2008&#47;08&#47;18&#47;software-development-is-a-creative-skill-building-houses-is-a-technical-one.aspx">post by Casey<&#47;a>.<&#47;li>
<li>Resharper 4.01 RC1 is out.<&#47;li>
<li>ASP.NET MVC now and in the future (i.e. where it's going, and&nbsp;perhaps a discussion on future of monorail vs. MVC and Monorail&nbsp;2??).<&#47;li>
<li>Security practices on MVC, WCF etc.<&#47;li>
<li><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.redmine.org&#47;%20">Redmine<&#47;a> - an interesting (and&nbsp;nicer) alternative to Trac - wonder if there's an easy&nbsp;transition path for existing Trac sites?<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
<strong>Edit<&#47;strong>: updated this list with some suggestions from&nbsp;others.</p>
<p>If anyone has any topic suggestions - just make a post on this&nbsp;entry, or send me an email &#47; IM message.</p>
<p>Details of previous posts and directions etc. can be found <a href="http:&#47;&#47;wiki.bittercoder.com&#47;SylviaParkArchitectureChats.ashx">here&nbsp;on the wiki<&#47;a>.</p>
