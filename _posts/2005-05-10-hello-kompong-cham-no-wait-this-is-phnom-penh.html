  <strong>Hello Phnom Penh<&#47;strong><br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>
  Well I'm in Phnom Penh now.. the capital of Cambodia.&nbsp; I did<br />
  get on a bus headed for Komphong Cham, in fact we stopped there,<br />
  and I opted to pay an extra $2 US to take me to the capital<br />
  instead... I'm not sure why I changed plains...&nbsp;but I just<br />
  didn't feel like staying there - call it a vibe? But I just<br />
  wasn't keen, so I headed for the capital.<br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>
  The bus trip took about 9 to 10&nbsp;hours including stops, I<br />
  sorta phased out near the end, and dropped me in the middle of<br />
  town (or should I say city, apparently the population here is<br />
  about 1 million?) - and after that I grabbed a tuk tuk to the<br />
  Boeng Kak Lakeside district, AKA backpacker hell (and of course<br />
  I've already been offered fiky-fik&#47;boom-boom&#47;brown<br />
  (heroin?),marijuana, opimun and coke.&nbsp;<br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>
  At any rate I had a squiz at the "green lake guesthouse" - seemed<br />
  ok - so I've grabbed a $3&#47;night room there, hopefully It's not<br />
  too hot (Cambodia is definitely hotter then Laos, but the rain<br />
  seems to be counteracting that somewhat..&nbsp;go the&nbsp;rainy<br />
  season!)<br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>
  The "hilight" of the bus trip would have to be the trip from<br />
  Strung Treng to Kratie, which is on roads which I imagine were<br />
  adequate back in the day (they appear to have been sealed once) -<br />
  but now they've decayed to an endless string of pot<br />
  holes&nbsp;which the bus I was riding&nbsp;navigated at what I<br />
  estimate to be about&nbsp;30 km&#47;hr - fun fun fun, The major<br />
  problem here is that Cambodia is very very flat... and the roads<br />
  appear to be uncrowned and the same height as the very very flat<br />
  plain... ipso factso it's a disaster.. however I think my years<br />
  of dealing with Northland&nbsp;metal roads on my parents "ticki<br />
  tours" in New Zealand&nbsp;as a kid had prepared me well ;o)<br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>
  The things that strike me in Cambodia as different to everywhere<br />
  else I've been (so far) is.. horses.. they seem to be quite<br />
  common in Cambodia, and used for all sorts of meanial labour that<br />
  would fall upon the water buffalo or "japanese buffalo"<br />
  (tractor&#47;hoe contraption) back in Laos.&nbsp; The horses however<br />
  are very small, and seem to look kinda like their going to drop<br />
  dead from Exhaustion..<br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>
  After I sat down and watched the sun set I chilled out a little<br />
  from my trip.. talked to a Cambodian student named "paul" (or<br />
  something that sounds like paul)&nbsp;for an hour or two then<br />
  meandered off to find food, eventually settling on the "Lazy<br />
  Gecko" which is just up the road -&nbsp;they charge loads ($4<br />
  US!)&nbsp;- but did serve me pork chops, nice gravey and mashed<br />
  potatoes with a tastey mixed fruit shake... I would never have<br />
  thought I could actually miss mashed potatoes, but I did!<br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>
  While talking to "Paul" we discussed various things such as the<br />
  apparent corruption in government ..."Mr Private" kept cropping<br />
  up, apparently he's done wonderful things for the<br />
  country&nbsp;such as selling the tourism rights to Angkor Wat to<br />
  the vietnamese, deforestation of Phnom Penh (which they now blame<br />
  for the droughts here) and Taking bribes from Thailand to not<br />
  enlarge the airport allowing for international air traffic&nbsp;-<br />
  wether the lad was exagerating, who knows.. but he seemed pretty<br />
  upset)<br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>
  Poverty is definitely more "in your face" here - the contrast of<br />
  wealth and poverty is massive.. people drive $100K plus cars past<br />
  you in the street&nbsp;while just steps from this internet cafe<br />
  people are crammed into a single room like sardines,<br />
  grandparents, parents and children.&nbsp;<br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>
  From what I've read (and talking to Paul) - the ratio's run<br />
  something like 5 million employed, 3 million self employed and 4<br />
  million unemployed in Cambodia - with the self employed all on or<br />
  below the poverty line.. They had a riot earlier this year and<br />
  with over half the population under the age of 16 I wouldn't be<br />
  surprised if more occur in the future as the majority of<br />
  the&nbsp;population&nbsp;get to the age of voting (or realising<br />
  there vote doesn't count for much in a reasonably corrupt<br />
  system).<br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>
  While we're talking numbers, apparently the infant mortality rate<br />
  here is around 9% at birth...&nbsp; Joy!<br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>
  Oh and I'm going to the killing fields tomorrow... so I'll<br />
  appologise in advance for any emotive trite I end up posting<br />
  around that trip, as who can say what effects seeing 8 or 9<br />
  thousand humans skulls will have on me... probably apathy, but<br />
  I'd like to think I may be touched on a more then statistical<br />
  level.<br />
<&#47;p></p>

  My mouse appears to be full of fluid and contains a small rubber<br />
  duck..?<br />
