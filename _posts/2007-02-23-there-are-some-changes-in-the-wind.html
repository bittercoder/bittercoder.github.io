    The thought had seriously crossed my mind Hammet!

    I need some NZ capacity at any rate, for the afore-mentioned client-continuity, otherwise I'll never be able to take a holiday ;o) but I would be very interested in what Castle Stronghold could offer a New Zealand development operation (Rates, required lead time before project commences, timezone differences etc.) - would it be worth my while sending you an email?

<h2>Changes in the wind...<&#47;h2><br />
I'm looking at expanding my operation (<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.devdefined.com&#47;">Dev Defined Limited<&#47;a>) - after&nbsp;having come to the conclusion that I can't support my current&nbsp;client base, and certainly can't offer them enough business&nbsp;continuity should I be put out of action - short of taking key man&nbsp;insurance out on myself ;o) - I need to start growing.</p>
<p>At any rate I've decided to do a few things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start engaging old clients (and finding new clients) to queue&nbsp;up more work beyond my capacity.<&#47;li>
<li>Taking on additional staff to both do that work, and transfer&nbsp;knowledge about existing clients and solutions.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ol><br />
Which brings me to the point of this post, I'm going to be&nbsp;looking for a couple of additional development staff (both&nbsp;senior).</p>
<p>So if you're a flexible senior developer, with a strong .Net&nbsp;background who wants to help build a development shop up, and is&nbsp;looking for opportunities to stretch their legs and play with some&nbsp;new and interesting technologies (instead of just reading about&nbsp;them on blogs) then why not drop me a line?</p>
<p>Our projects cover a wide variety of areas, looking back over the&nbsp;past 8 months some of the more interesting bits of work have&nbsp;been:</p>
<ul>
<li>A client server system for audio identification, using WCF,&nbsp;Base4.Net with a Monorail based web front-end.<&#47;li>
<li>Rich message processing system for <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.syzmk.com&#47;">Seismic Technologies<&#47;a>, a large&nbsp;solution that included a rich winforms based remote configuration&nbsp;interface, integrated <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.codeplex.com&#47;ironpython">IronPython<&#47;a> scripting,&nbsp;heavy use of dependency injection, WSE 3.0 and IoC.<&#47;li>
<li>Library for media transformations (designed to plug-in to the&nbsp;SyzmkRMP product, but also for other users) - including an&nbsp;Audio&#47;Video encoding library that wraps up DirectShow.Net which&nbsp;was open-sourced as the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.codeplex.com&#47;splicer&#47;">Splicer<&#47;a> project on&nbsp;codeplex.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
Starting package would be $85K + 5 weeks holiday, Pay review after&nbsp;6 months.</p>
<p>And on the flip-side of that coin, I'm looking for additional&nbsp;project&#47;product development work to take on board, so if you have a&nbsp;project that you think would benefit from our unique set of skills&nbsp;and experience and a team of developers with a focus on innovative&nbsp;solutions, drop us an <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.devdefined.com&#47;Home&#47;Contact.rails">email<&#47;a>.</p>
