  content: "Perhaps, I'm fairly forgiving in these circumstances for a first offense
    :) often small companies paint themselves into a corner i.e. no redundancy or
    too many overloaded roles.\n\nNormally that can either be a call to action, or
    the beginning of the end.  If it happens again I would definitely be looking for
    an exit path to another supplier/product (truth be told I'd probably be looking
    for an alternative product in preparation after the first \"scare\", with the
    hope of not needing it). \n\nMany developers are willing to admit business skills
    and strong technical skills don't always come together in the one package :) so
    you often have to take the good with the bad with some small providers while they
    learn the associated business lessons the hard way.\n\nJust my opinion at any
    rate, I'm not about to throw the baby out with the bath water."

<p><b>Update:</b> 22<sup>nd</sup> May 2008 - Please if you have any<br>
.Net reactor related queries, post them to this <a href="http://groups.google.co.nz/group/net-reactor-users?hl=en">google<br>
group</a>, rather then emailing me directly, as you're more likely<br>
to get a response.&nbsp; Cheers!<br><br>
<br><br>
If you recall in the last Architecture Chat (<a href="http://blog.bittercoder.com/PermaLink,guid,b7a4c0be-312f-4261-ad5d-9906d179dbb6.aspx">#21</a>)<br>
Gareth of <a href="http://www.slyce.com/">Slyce Software</a><br>
mentioned the demise of .<a href="http://www.eziriz.com/products.htm">Net Reactor</a>, a German code<br>
obfuscation product that many users swear by.. but over the past 2<br>
or so months it went completely dark as the company ceased<br>
responding to any correspondence, or making releases - where as<br>
prior they were almost phenomenally fast to get back to queries,<br>
and we releasing every couple of weeks.<br><br>
<br><br>
Well I got an interesting email from a .Net Reactor user who has<br>
been suffering the same issues, not having a response out the<br>
company in the last couple of months but he did advise that<br>
releases are starting to flow out the company again, with 3 new<br>
versions released in December... so things could be looking up,<br>
even if the wall of silence continues.<br><br>
<br><br>
Apparently it got so bad that even some add-on vendors have<br>
withdrawn in-prorgess products due to a lack of communication with<br>
Eziriz - what I find interesting here is how quickly all the good<br>
work you can do building up a community around a product for<br>
developers can unwind - and demonstrates how important a visible<br>
"heartbeat" for a product is to keeping trust in your project - be<br>
it through regular releases, actively participating in forums and<br>
mailing lists or at the very least publishing the odd bit of news<br>
on your site.<br><br>
<br><br>
Fingers crossed the company starts answering peoples emails again<br>
at any rate - it'd be a shame to see a popular product's community<br>
turn their back on it just because their worried it's going to<br>
dissappear completely.<br><br>
<br><br>
Right, so yes, there is a point to this post - assuming the worst<br>
and .Net Reactor is winding down, can anyone else recommend an<br>
obfuscation/licensing products in the sub 300 US$ range that works<br>
well?<br><br>
<br><br>
<b>Edit:</b><br><br>
<br><br>
Shortly after posting this I was notified that Apparently<br>
everything is good once more in .Net Reactor land with the lead<br>
developer having been taken away from development due to other life<br>
issues taking over in the later part of last year, but he's back<br>
and developing/communicating once more so it should be "business as<br>
usual".<br><br>
<br><br>
I look forward to seeing what cool things Eziriz get up to in<br>
2008!<br><br>
<br><br>
<b>Edit (Again):</b><br><br>
<br><br>
And shortly after that I also got an email, so everything is<br>
definitely fine once more with .Net Reactor:</p>
<blockquote style="font-style: italic"><p>Dear Mr. Henderson, I am sorry for the problems you had with my<br>
  product support. Gareth Hayter referred me to your blog. Please<br>
  be sure, .NET Reactor product development/support is firing on<br>
  all cylinders again.<br><br>
  <br><br>
  Best regards,<br><br>
  <br><br>
  Denis Mierzwiak, Chief Technical Officer.<br>
</p></blockquote>
