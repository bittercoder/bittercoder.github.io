<h2>
  Breaking scripts<br />
</h2></p>
<p>
  I've been thinking about the issues involved with using<br />
  IronPython in a product as a scripting language, internally we've<br />
  already struggled at Syzmk with my love of refactoring breaking<br />
  scripts in our deployed products left right and centre.<br />
</p></p>
<p>
  I think the problems I need to solve first are:<br />
</p></p>
<ul>
<li>Ensuring an understanding of the user experience when<br />
  scripting with the application (read: dogfooding the scripting<br />
  experience)<br /><br />
  </li></p>
<li>Making sure I identify where helper classes / wrappers etc.<br />
  may be necessary to make the scripting experience more palatable<br />
  to end users.<br />
  </li></p>
<li>Ensuring any changes don't clobber the contracts between the<br />
  scripting language and the client when refactoring the underlying<br />
  .Net classes they rely on.<br />
  </li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>
  Regression tests for expected script usage is what it comes<br />
  down... but if you sit down and start trying to write these tests<br />
  in NUnit it all gets a bit unwieldy - there's a lot of time<br />
  wasted making sure your tabs are right, escaping characters<br />
  correctly in strings, and running scripts, evaluating the<br />
  results, and then asserting against them - it's frustrating, and<br />
  fails to emulate the experience of your users who are writing<br />
  scripts purely in Python.<br />
</p></p>
<h2>
  PyUnit?<br />
</h2></p>
<p>
  So my next port of call was to try the unit testing support that<br />
  comes with python (PyUnit) - it would definitely do the job - but<br />
  then I need to do a couple of things... first I need to start<br />
  bundling quite a few standard libraries with the scripting engine<br />
  in our product, and then I have to write additional functionality<br />
  to support capturing the results of running the PyUnit tests and<br />
  presenting them to the automated build process... It's all<br />
  sounding like a pain in the ass, and&nbsp; the automation build<br />
  works nicely as it is, I'd rather not have to mess with it...<br />
</p></p>
<p>
  So I decided to do a little integration work, to see if I could<br />
  run a test suite written in python as part of a C# assembly.<br />
</p></p>
<h2>
  NUnit meets (Iron)Python<br />
</h2></p>
<p>
  First off, my solutions user experience is ok - not perfect - but<br />
  then I just wanted to make sure I could get it working, before I<br />
  put any effort into cleaning it up, and not being an expert in<br />
  extending NUnit, or coding python, it was probably doomed from<br />
  the start to be a mediocre solution ;o)<br />
</p></p>
<p>
  The steps to get it working in a test assembly are:<br />
</p></p>
<ol>
<li>Writing a fixture in python, and including it in the assembly<br />
  as an embedded resource.<br />
  </li></p>
<li>Creating a suite which references the embedded python files -<br />
  this is a class derived from the "AbstractPythonSuite".<br /><br />
  </li></p>
<li>Creating a Suite builder (I had to do this in the test<br />
  assembly itself, because it wasn't working when I bundled this in<br />
  a support library).<br />
  </li></p>
<li>Run the suite ;o)<br />
  </li><br />
</ol></p>
<p>
  First off, we write the fixture, the only requirements are:<br />
</p></p>
<ul>
<li>The fixture class is derived from "NUnitFixture".<br />
  </li></p>
<li>The test methods are prefixed with "test" - as per PyUnit.<br />
  And take only a "self" argument.<br />
  </li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>
  Here's an example fixture:<br />
</p></p>
<pre>
import System<br />
from System import Console</p>
<p>class MyPythonFixture(NUnitFixture):</p>
<p>    def testPass(self):<br />
        Console.WriteLine("--testPass--")<br />
        Assert.IsTrue(True)</p>
<p>    def testFail(self):<br />
        Console.WriteLine("--testFail--")<br />
        Assert.IsTrue(False, "this will fail")<br />
</pre></p>
<p>
  As you can see we are just using the existing NUnit Assert<br />
  methods... There is one caveat to this that I will cover in<br />
  another post (that of testing for expected exceptions).<br /><br />
</p></p>
<p>
  Next we create a suite - which can wrap one or more python script<br />
  files (included as assembly resources) - this is all we need to<br />
  bridge the gap.<br />
</p></p>
<pre>
public class MyPythonSuite : AbstractPythonSuite<br />
{<br />
    public MyPythonSuite()<br />
        : base("MyPythonFixture.py")<br />
    {<br />
    }<br />
}<br />
</pre></p>
<p>
  And last of all, we need to drop in a suite builder - in theory I<br />
  should be able to include this in a support assembly - but it<br />
  doesn't seem to work, here's the code:<br />
</p></p>
<pre>
[SuiteBuilder]<br />
public class PythonSuiteExtensionBuilder : ISuiteBuilder<br />
{<br />
    public TestSuite BuildFrom(Type type, int assemblyKey)<br />
    {<br />
        if (CanBuildFrom(type))  return new PythonSuiteExtension(type, assemblyKey);<br />
        return null;<br />
    }</p>
<p>    public bool CanBuildFrom(Type type)<br />
    {<br />
        return (typeof(AbstractPythonSuite).IsAssignableFrom(type) &amp;&amp; (type != typeof(AbstractPythonSuite)));<br />
    }<br />
}<br />
</pre></p>
<p>
  At this point when can test the assembly with <b>NUnitGui</b>,<br />
  and see our python fixtures appear under the "MyPythonSuite"...<br />
  pretty slick huh?<br /><br />
</p></p>
<p>

</p></p>
<p>
  <br /><br />
  The big downsides of this approach are that you can't run the<br />
  tests individually using something like <b>TestDriven.Net</b>,<br />
  and <b>Resharper</b>'s unit test window doesn't pick them up...<br />
  However <b>NUnitGui</b> and the corresponding <b>NUnitConsole</b><br />
  have no problems with them, and running all the tests in your<br />
  assembly with <b>TestDriven.Net</b> does pick them up thankfully<br />
  - so as long you don't have many slow tests in your assembly it<br />
  should still be tolerable (you can run them while still<br />
  coding...).<br />
</p></p>
<p>
  And of course, they will be picked up in your automated builds -<br />
  which is great news for me... I hate messing around with<br />
  CruiseControl.Net's configuration.<br /><br />
</p></p>
<p>
  I'll tidy up the implementation a little and post the code<br />
  soon.<br /><br />
</p></p>
