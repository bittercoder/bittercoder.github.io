    I'm not sure how it would compare to a product like Episever (http://www.episerver.com/) - but I don't think it would be too bad - it is the recommended upgrade path from the defunct Microsoft CMS.

    Personally I haven't done any MOSS 2007 project's yet, this was just WSS 3.0 with a 3rd party Workflow product... and was a business application (no content management) - but I suspect it probably wouldn't be all that bad ... most of the SharePoint features (in one form or another) lend themselves to CMS - it isn't exactly rocket science in many cases, the fundamentals of a content management system haven't really changed in the last 10 years... And SharePoint designer (in between it's little hickups) is a pretty good tool, allowing you to avoid having to use dev resource to make changes in many cases.

    I know a few people who have done or are doing CMS projects with SharePoint - I'll ask around next time and see what peoples experiences have been like pre and post deployment.

<p>I've been working with SharePoint lately, it's a technology of&nbsp;highs and lows... the highs are when you've finally got something&nbsp;to work that should've worked in the first place, the lows are&nbsp;well... all the times in between.</p>
<p>Ok, so that sounds cynical - SharePoint is actually quite a cool&nbsp;product - there's a lot of good in there... stuff that would take&nbsp;you a while to write yourself... but it just tends to drive you a&nbsp;bit crazy, things that look easy from a distance become hard to&nbsp;achieve because of poor documentation, lack of extension points and&nbsp;the difficulty in building testable code.</p>
<p>At any rate, while on this project I've been compiling a <a href="http://wiki.bittercoder.com/SharePointHacks.ashx">list of&nbsp;hacks</a> that other people may find useful, which I used to solve&nbsp;a few of the problems I was hitting while developing... here are&nbsp;the first few:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://wiki.bittercoder.com/AlteringDefaultHourForDateFields.ashx">Altering the default hour of DateTime fields in a ListForm.</a></li>
<li><a href="http://wiki.bittercoder.com/DefaultingOneDateFieldToAnotherDateField.ashx">Defaulting one date field to another in a ListForm.</a></li>
<li><a href="http://wiki.bittercoder.com/SPListItemIsDirty.ashx">Determining&nbsp;if a SPListItem is dirty.</a></li><br />
</ul><br />
There are some more coming shortly.</p>
