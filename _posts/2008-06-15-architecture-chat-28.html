<p>5 people turned up This week.</p>
<p>Peter kicked off t1he discussion with a review of the Agricultural&nbsp;Field days in a disheartening lack of <span>anything</span> IT there, this sparked&nbsp;an interesting discussion around&nbsp;what's holding back adoption of technologies such as RFID's for&nbsp;animal identification and some possible inhibiting factors, like&nbsp;the cost to early adoptors, education etc.</p>
<p>After this we returned to more mundane things... first off we&nbsp;Discussed <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/velocity/">Velocity</a> a&nbsp;bit, comparing it to memcached and some of the interesting features&nbsp;like tagging and the current lack of push functionality in the&nbsp;CTP.</p>
<p><a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2008/06/06/silverlight-2-beta2-released.aspx"><br />
Silverlight 2 beta 2</a> was next... talked about the new visual&nbsp;state manager and designer integration into Expression Blend. &nbsp;I noticed after the chat that <a href="http://hestia.typepad.com/flatlander/">Ivan</a> has posted an<br />
<a href="http://hestia.typepad.com/flatlander/2008/06/why-the-silverl.html"><br />
Interesting discussion</a> around why he believes the Visual State&nbsp;Manager isn't a great idea - during the chat we did puzzle a little&nbsp;over why silverlight is diverging from WPF, and just how&nbsp;cross-polination between WPF and Siliverlight will occur.</p>
<p>Other things that interested us about the silverlight 2 beta 2&nbsp;release were Inking &amp; Stylus support (and incidentally&nbsp;second-hand tablet PC's are becoming dirt cheap, so no excuse not&nbsp;to have one lying on your desk!).</p>
<p>Multi-tile source, which could prove interesting for providing&nbsp;information generated on the fly or integrated with existing GIS&nbsp;sources etc.</p>
<p>Cross-domain support, background thread support for networking and&nbsp;duplex WCF communications - I could see this providing interesting&nbsp;possibilities, i.e. a silverlight control that makes the web client&nbsp;a temporary member of a grid network, perhaps distributed virally&nbsp;as a facebook app.&nbsp; Not to mention the more mundane business&nbsp;applications.</p>
<p>After talking silverlight for a while Jamie then mentioned the&nbsp;OAuth library I'd written - so I went through what OAuth is/does&nbsp;vs. OpenID (there seems a bit of confusion in some peoples minds of&nbsp;what each of these projects aims to achieve) and then what's been<br />
implemented, and what is yet to come - for more info on the OAuth&nbsp;library check out this <a href="http://code.google.com/p/devdefined-tools/wiki/OAuth">wiki</a>&nbsp;page.</p>
<p>A rambling discussion sparked off by Peter mentioning IBM having&nbsp;<a href="http://news.cnet.com/2100-1010_3-6193211.html">broken the<br />
"petaflop barrier"</a> and the gradual approach towards a platform&nbsp;for an accurate simulation of the human brain, I made some&nbsp;references to "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_a_Strange_Loop">I am a strange&nbsp;loop</a>" and everyone talked about the general difficulties with&nbsp;artificial inteligence and the current predictions regarding when&nbsp;computers will have enough horsepower to emulate brain&nbsp;function.</p>
<p>Thanks all for coming - see you all in a couple of weeks (Thursday&nbsp;26th June).</p>
