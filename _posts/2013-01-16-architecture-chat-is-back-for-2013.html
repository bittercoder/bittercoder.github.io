<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>It's 2013, and the Architecture Chat is back for the new year, after taking a little break.</p>
<p>We will be meeting this <strong>Thursday, 17th January at 11:30am</strong>, at <a href="http://benedictioncafe.co.nz/">Benediction Cafe, Newton</a>.</p>
<p>We are collecting topics on the following google doc:</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g2rCkS1DhnpulLlEjIsCL_ayrATC5zifLjyViz_jEYM/edit">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g2rCkS1DhnpulLlEjIsCL_ayrATC5zifLjyViz_jEYM/edit</a></p>
<p>And if you have not been to the Architecture Chat before, you can find more about it here:</p>

<p>Also, don't forget that <a href="http://codemania.co.nz">Codemania</a> is on the 12th April, 2013 this year, <strong><a href="http://codemania.co.nz/Register">with tickets on sale now</a></strong>.  </p>
<p>Early-bird pricing runs out on the 13th of Feb - this year also sees the introduction of a couple of half-day workshops as well. </p>
<p>More goodness for all!</p>
