<p>Just a quick note that the Architecture chat that was scheduled for&nbsp;this thursday is going to be postponed until Next Thursday&nbsp;(December 6th) because I'm unavailable this week.</p>
<p>I'll post about it and email the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;dot.net.nz&#47;">dot.net.nz<&#47;a> user group (for you&nbsp;non-subscribing philistines :) next week to remind you all.</p>
<p>See you all next week!</p>
