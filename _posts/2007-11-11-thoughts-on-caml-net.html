<p>So first off... for those who don't know SharePoint... &nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Collaborative_Application_Markup_Language">CAML<&#47;a> is a bit of swiss army knife... if you understand it, can&nbsp;stand it, and know where to stick it you can pull off some&nbsp;interesting and useful results with SharePoint... I'm no expert&nbsp;however, having only touched it for querying and tweaking it here&nbsp;and there for some custom views. Though I think I can confidently&nbsp;say CAML is a wonderful example of XML Abuse :)</p>
<p>At any rate, one aspect of CAML is being able to write CAML queries&nbsp;to query data sources i.e. SharePoint Lists.... I'm against&nbsp;constructing strings for querying data sources, because they're&nbsp;ugly - and difficult to mutate with code, so I decided to give&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;camldotnet.com&#47;">CAML.Net<&#47;a> a try (and ended up&nbsp;using it, albeit reluctantly) - here's an example query in&nbsp;CAML:</p>
<pre><Where> <Or> <Eq> <FieldRef Name="ContentType" &#47;> <Value Type="Text">My Content Type<&#47;Value> <&#47;Eq> <IsNull> <FieldRef Name="Description" &#47;> <&#47;IsNull> <&#47;Or> <&#47;Where><&#47;pre><br />
And then in CAML.Net - at first glance it looks ok:</p>
<pre>Console.WriteLine(CAML.Where( CAML.Or( CAML.Eq( CAML.FieldRef("ContentType"), CAML.Value("My Content Type")), CAML.IsNull( CAML.FieldRef("Description")))));<&#47;pre><br />
But of course then you look a little closer and see that&nbsp;CAML.Where, CAML.Or, CAML.Eq etc. all return strings... so your not&nbsp;actually building a model of your query - which to me immediately&nbsp;removes a large part of the value for this solution.</p>
<p>Looking around the blog-sphere I see lots of people using CAML.Net,&nbsp;and yet nobody seems to have a problem with the way it works?... it&nbsp;puzzles me... At any rate.. let's dive into why I don't like this&nbsp;approach... with another example:</p>
<pre>Console.WriteLine(CAML.Where( CAML.Or( CAML.Eq( CAML.FieldRef("Title"), CAML.Value("My Title")), CAML.Or( CAML.Eq( CAML.FieldRef("ContentType"), CAML.Value("My Content Type")), CAML.IsNull( CAML.FieldRef("Description"))))));<&#47;pre><br />
And here's the CAML for that:</p>
<pre><Where> <Or> <Eq> <FieldRef Name="Title" &#47;> <Value Type="Text">My Title<&#47;Value> <&#47;Eq> <Or> <Eq> <FieldRef Name="ContentType" &#47;> <Value Type="Text">My Content Type<&#47;Value> <&#47;Eq> <IsNull> <FieldRef Name="Description" &#47;> <&#47;IsNull> <&#47;Or> <&#47;Or> <&#47;Where><&#47;pre><br />
Notice the Or inside an Or... this is direct feedback from the CAML&nbsp;query language itself - notably that you can't construct a query&nbsp;with multiple root-level criteria, so your left to construct a tree&nbsp;of Or and And's as required to represent your query - which is&nbsp;ugly, and ultimately confusing - it doesn't express intent well...&nbsp;So my first problem with the CAML.Net approach is it makes me aware&nbsp;of the problems in CAML, when they could've been abstracted away&nbsp;for me... now let's look at a reasonably dynamic CAML query.</p>
<pre>string title = "My Title"; string contentType = "My Content Type"; List<string> orFragments = new List<string>(); if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(title)) { orFragments.Add(CAML.Eq( CAML.FieldRef("Title"), CAML.Value(title))); } if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(contentType)) { orFragments.Add(CAML.Eq( CAML.FieldRef("ContentType"), CAML.Value(contentType))); } orFragments.Add(CAML.IsNull(CAML.FieldRef("Description"))); string query = CAML.Where( OrCamlRange(orFragments.ToArray()));<&#47;pre><br />
And suddenly I'm forced into a world of pain - having to manage the&nbsp;various criteria myself, and strings no less - in this case I'm&nbsp;only using Or's - so I can use a little function to stitch&nbsp;everything into a valid query:</p>
<pre>private static string OrCamlRange(string[] items) { if ((items == null) || (items.Length < 1)) throw new ArgumentNullException("items"); if (items.Length == 1) return items[0]; string[] remainingItems = new string[items.Length - 1]; Array.Copy(items, 1, remainingItems, 0, remainingItems.Length); return CAML.Or(items[0], OrCamlRange(remainingItems)); }<&#47;pre><br />
But I can't help feeling that an opportunity for CAML.Net to really&nbsp;shine has been tarnished by an initial design choice of returning&nbsp;strings, instead of models.&nbsp; At least for my use cases, I&nbsp;would've been much happier with something that returned a model&nbsp;which I could post-parse - to smarten up the experience so I could&nbsp;identify misspelled fields, mutate the query based on user choices&nbsp;etc.</p>
<p>Finally, just to be clear - this is not a dig at <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.johnholliday.net&#47;">John Holliday<&#47;a> - CAML.Net's&nbsp;author, he's a smart guy who knows a lot more then I ever will&nbsp;about SharePoint!&nbsp; It's merely an opinion&#47;observation on the&nbsp;negatives of query building approaches which don't embrace an&nbsp;intermediate model which can be parsed or mutated.</p>
