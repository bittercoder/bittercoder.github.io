<p class="MsoNormal">Sorry about the much belated write-up for the last Architecture&nbsp;Chat, been rushed off my feet of late, though a whole week's gone&nbsp;by now ... so the only real excuse could be that I've been a&nbsp;slack bastid.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">So, first off... terrible turn out, with only myself and an envoy&nbsp;from <a href="http://www.intergen.co.nz/">Intergen</a> turning up&nbsp;- hopefully not a sign of things to come (small numbers that is,&nbsp;not the intergen guys ;o) and also hopefully not something to put&nbsp;off the Intergen guys from making the trip out this way again&nbsp;(though I suspect Kurt would do it just to get Mexican) - Not to&nbsp;mention Peter losing out on some vital opportunities to introduce&nbsp;Wiki-love to some new comers!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">So, as opposed to the usual mixed bag of discussions we focused&nbsp;largely on what tooling and practices Intergen Auckland use (and&nbsp;by comparison myself) - internally it sounds like they have a big&nbsp;drive towards</p>
<ul>
<li>"All sorts of testing"</li>
<li>Continuous Integration / Build Servers</li><br>
</ul>
<p class="MsoNormal">So we covered <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_Integration">continuous&nbsp;integration</a> (<a href="http://confluence.public.thoughtworks.org/display/CCNET/Welcome+to+CruiseControl.NET">CC.Net</a>)&nbsp;... make tools i.e. <a href="http://nant.sourceforge.net/">Nant</a>, which has adoption&nbsp;within Intergen, and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/msbuild/">MSBuild</a> which I use (mostly&nbsp;because I swapped over during the first beta of VS2005, prior to&nbsp;Nant having support for the Framework 2.0, and never moved back)&nbsp;- the key observation was that MSBuild just seems to have very&nbsp;unintuitive syntax - i.e. a Nant build scripts reads a lot more&nbsp;like plain English then a MSBuild equivalent.<span>&nbsp;</span> I asked if anyone had tried <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/">TeamCity</a>, which they&nbsp;had, but without much success (much like my own experience).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Installers were next on the agenda - I'm a big supporter of&nbsp;<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/wix">WiX</a>, though the&nbsp;feeling from &nbsp;some of the guys at Intergen (and I think many&nbsp;people out in the wild) is that getting a WiX installer off the&nbsp;ground was a cumbersome experience, but on the flip side the&nbsp;"setup" project isn't as friendly when it comes to continuous &nbsp;integration or support concurrent development (merging setup&nbsp;projects, ugh!) - I expressed my views on the fact that WiX is a&nbsp;hell of a lot easier to maintain once it's in place (i.e.&nbsp;figuring out changes other developers have made), and that making&nbsp;use of tools like Heat that come with WiX can accelerate your&nbsp;development effort quite a lot - Once you have a couple of&nbsp;reference projects with WiX installers it's very easy to rinse&nbsp;and repeat for new projects, or perhaps keep a library of wix&nbsp;templates on a wiki ;o)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Source control cropped up - I use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subversion_%28software%29">Subversion</a>&nbsp;- From what was mentioned Intergen are using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Studio_Team_System">Team&nbsp;System</a>, though TFS does plenty of things SVN does not (Merge&nbsp;history and light-weight labeling appeal to me) - the lack of a&nbsp;good "off line" story still annoyed everyone at the table - maybe&nbsp;once SVN Bridge is half way stable, this won't be such a&nbsp;problem..?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">That lead into issue tracking and bug management - where I&nbsp;generally use <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/">Trac</a>,&nbsp;though for some clients I'm migrating to <a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/">Jira</a> (Trac comes&nbsp;across as "to simple" to clients for some reason, especially to&nbsp;dedicated testers, but I'm still a little puzzled as to why,&nbsp;perhaps they just don't get the "wiki" side of things?)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><a href="http://studios.thoughtworks.com/mingle-project-intelligence/">Mingle</a>&nbsp;also came up in conversation - which is a product I'd never taken&nbsp;a look at - after a quick look around the site it looks pretty&nbsp;cool, especially with the source control aspect, I will&nbsp;definitely need to explore it further, though even something with&nbsp;about 80% of its &nbsp;features as a Trac plug-in would suite my needs&nbsp;... any readers out there using mingle who can offer an opinion?</p><br>
I also brought up the news of the &nbsp;<a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/10/03/releasing-the-source-code-for-the-net-framework-libraries.aspx">framework code being made available</a> - I'm not really sure it&nbsp;registered, or perhaps there just wasn't a need (we've all got so&nbsp;used to using reflector) ... though at the moment I'd rather have&nbsp;the SharePoint source code then the framework (especially&nbsp;considering parts of the sharepoint framework are&nbsp;obfuscated).
<p>Hopefully next week we'll be back on track for next Thursday with a&nbsp;few of the regulars, or if Thursday is turning into a "bad day" for&nbsp;everyone then perhaps we need to mix it up a little.</p>
<p>See you all there!</p>
