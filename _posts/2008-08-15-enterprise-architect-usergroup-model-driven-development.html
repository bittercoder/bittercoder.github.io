<p>Yesterday afternoon I &nbsp;<a href="http://www.catchlimited.com/moduleinterface.php?module=News&amp;id=cntnt01&amp;cntnt01action=detail&amp;cntnt01articleid=46&amp;cntnt01returnid=78">presented</a> a quick 20 minute presentation to the <a href="http://www.catch.net.nz/sparxsystems/forum/">Enterprise Architect<br>
user group</a> - it was an interesting opportunity to talk with&nbsp;both an Enterprise Architect lead developer and analysts/BA's etc.&nbsp;who are using Enterprise Architect on a daily basis - there's&nbsp;nothing quite like doing something and then even more so presenting&nbsp;on what you've done to really firm up some conclusions / ideas&nbsp;around it (and as is often the case with me, spark 20 ideas for new&nbsp;products I could build to make it better/smarter).</p>
<p>For anyone who's interested here's the <a href="http://blog.bittercoder.com/content/binary/MDG_Presentation.pdf">slide&nbsp;deck</a> I presented - and also some links to things that were&nbsp;discussed:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.sparxsystems.com.au/">Enterprise&nbsp;Architect</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.sparxsystems.com.au/products/mdg/int/vs/index.html">MDG Integration for Visual Studio .Net</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.omg.org/technology/documents/formal/ocl.htm">OCL</a>&nbsp;(object constraint language) - we also discussed OCL tutorials,<br>
of which I've found <a href="http://www.sciences.univ-nantes.fr/lina/atl/atldemo/oclturorial/">this site</a> to be useful in the past.</li><br>
</ul><br>
Thanks to <a href="http://catch.net.nz/">catch</a> for hosting&nbsp;the group and providing the video conferencing facilities to link<br>
Auckland / Wellington (small tip, if you are presenting to two&nbsp;groups be sure to sit at the end of the table looking towards the&nbsp;camera, or your spend your whole time ping-ponging your head&nbsp;towards one group and the other ;) - and also thanks to everyone&nbsp;who came along and listened.
<p>Also of interest was the discussion after the presentation around&nbsp;providing a number of example/sample MDA transformations through&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sparxsystems.co.nz/">Sparx Systems New&nbsp;Zealand</a> site - which should mean that before the end of the&nbsp;year you will be seeing both guidance and examples on developing&nbsp;MDA transformations targeting NHibernate, NHibernate search,&nbsp;ActiveRecord, Monorail and RhinoSecurity starting to emerge (what I&nbsp;tend to loosely call the "Castle stack" for want of a better term.)&nbsp;- which I'll post about it as it starts to happen.</p>
