    Doh! oh well, better luck next time making it over this way... you might need to "accidentally" leave your mobile on your work desk next time you get a day off!  Will definitely have to get a North Shore meet up happening this year.

    Hope you had a good weekend and didn't get stuck at work!

<p>Architecture chat this Thursday, 5th February, 11:30am,&nbsp;Garrisons, Sylvia Park, Auckland.</p>

<li>Net negative producing programmers.&nbsp; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NNPP" target="_blank">NNPP</a>.&nbsp; Do we need barriers to entry into this<br />
profession, or some tools that can be used to persuade people to<br />
leave?&nbsp; And what's <a href="http://blog.jayfields.com/2009/01/cost-of-net-negative-producing.html">the cost</a> of NNPP?</li></p>

<li>What was good/bad about last year (both in the chat, NZ dev&nbsp;community and development space in general) and predictions for&nbsp;this year.</li>
<li>Traditional training for developers - do developers still&nbsp;attend training courses in NZ, where, what's the value etc.</li><br />
</ul><br />

</ul><br />
