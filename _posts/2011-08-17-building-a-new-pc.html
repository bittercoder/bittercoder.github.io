<p>It's been a while since I've had a full PC refresh, in fact it&nbsp;was back in 2007 - so I've been working with largely the same&nbsp;"bones" of a machine for 4 years (same case, power supply etc.).</p>
<p>I blogged (very briefly) about it at the time, because of the joy&nbsp;that was more then&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.bittercoder.com/PermaLink,guid,abbb4d91-ce8a-45e4-b0a3-e37ae80e17c0.aspx">doubling the speed of the machine while&nbsp;overclocking on air</a>.</p>
<p>But over the last years it's been getting to be a bit creaky,&nbsp;even with some &nbsp;CPU/motherboard refreshes etc. - so I decided to&nbsp;build a new machine.</p>
<p>As a quick refresh, this is what my old development <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/90926978@N00/sets/72157600275471860/">machine looks like.</a></p>
<p><a href="http://blog.bittercoder.com/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/e96d348341d0_11BCB/OldPC2_2.jpg"><img style="display: inline;" title="OldPC2" src="http://blog.bittercoder.com/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/e96d348341d0_11BCB/OldPC2_thumb.jpg" alt="OldPC2" />&nbsp;</a></p>
<h2>New Machine</h2><br />
Components I used:</p>
<ul>
<li>Corsair Graphite 600T White Case</li>
<li>Asus P8Z68-V Pro Motherboard</li>
<li>Intel Core i7 2600K 3.4GHz Socket 1155</li>
<li>Corsair XMS3 Vengeance DDR3 PC12800/1600MHz CL9 4x4GB</li>
<li>Corsair H80 cooler</li>
<li>Sapphire Radeon HD6850 HDMI Display Port Dual-DVI 1GB (since replaced with an HD6990)</li>
<li>Seasonic X-850 850W PSU (Since replaced with a 1200w Silverstone PSU)</li>
<li>Western Digital Caviar Green WD30EZRX 64MB 3TB</li>
<li>OCZ Vertex 3 Series SATA III 2.5" SSD 240GB</li>
<li>HP ZR30w 30" Monitor + Dell U3011 30" Monitor + Samsung SyncMaster 305T plus 30" Monitor.</li>
<li>Sennheiser PC-350 headphones</li><br />
</ul><br />
I ordered all of the parts in this build except the case&nbsp;initially, I had planned on using my existing Lian Li case - but&nbsp;after reading some reviews for the Corsair 600T, I decided to&nbsp;grab one, and I'm glad I did!? At the same time I also grabbed&nbsp;another monitor (HP ZR30w) - Interestingly the parts I decided to&nbsp;use independently ended up closely matching those in Jeff&nbsp;Attwood's <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2011/07/building-a-pc-part-vii-rebooting.html">new machine</a>, at least in New Zealand my&nbsp;choices are largely factored by price and availability (for&nbsp;example there just aren't that many DDR3 16gb kits around, and&nbsp;the Vengeance XMS3 is one of the cheaper).</p>
<p>As for the new case - The <a href="http://www.corsair.com/cases/graphite-series/graphite-series-600t.html">600T</a> is a delight to work on, loads of room,&nbsp;easy to remove/clean grills and panels, and the extra wide case&nbsp;allowing routing of cables underneath the tray and back in again&nbsp;makes it effortless to end up with something that's tidy and that&nbsp;you won't dread opening up in the future to work on.</p>
<p>I also have&nbsp;to give a hat-tip to the H80 cooler, for a all-in-one water&nbsp;cooling solution, it delivers on performance and is incredibly&nbsp;easy to install, took me all of about 3 minutes.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.bittercoder.com/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/e96d348341d0_11BCB/NewPC_6.png"><img style="display: inline;" title="NewPC" src="http://blog.bittercoder.com/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/e96d348341d0_11BCB/NewPC_thumb_2.png" alt="NewPC" /></a></p>
<p>I love how "clean" this case feels, it's extremely well&nbsp;designed.</p>
<p>Contrast it with my old PC's cabling, when first&nbsp;built:</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.bittercoder.com/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/e96d348341d0_11BCB/OldPC_2.jpg"><img style="display: inline;" title="OldPC" src="http://blog.bittercoder.com/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/e96d348341d0_11BCB/OldPC_thumb.jpg" alt="OldPC" /></a></p>
<p>And the sad state it's in now (I'm in the process of stripping it&nbsp;down/cleaning/rebuilding it - so it's missing a few additional&nbsp;120mm fans here and there (also check out the "awesome" cable&nbsp;tied fan cooling the memory ;o)</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.bittercoder.com/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/e96d348341d0_11BCB/Dust_2.png"><img style="display: inline;" title="Dust" src="http://blog.bittercoder.com/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/e96d348341d0_11BCB/Dust_thumb.png" alt="Dust" /></a></p>
<p>Some catches with this new build I hit:</p>
<ul>
<li>If "hot plug" is disabled for the SATA 3 ports in BIOS, you&nbsp;get intermittent freezes (normally about 10 minutes after&nbsp;booting, freeze can last for up to a couple of minutes) - took a&nbsp;while to figure that one out.</li>
<li>System doesn't like resuming from sleep if the PPL&nbsp;Overvoltage setting is enabled.</li>
<li>The H80 fans started "pulsing" after a couple of days (The&nbsp;H80 CPU block also doubles as a fan controller, where pushing the&nbsp;centre of the cooler switches between 3 fan speeds) - The pulsing&nbsp;didn't seem to change the performance of the cooler that much,&nbsp;but the noise drives you crazy - I opted to just attach the fans<br />
to the bundled fan controller that comes as part of this case,&nbsp;which worked around the issue, I suspect the resolution to this&nbsp;issue is to RMA the unit (which I can't be bothered doing now it's installed).</li></p>
<li>I currently have the cooler configured to pull air in from&nbsp;outside - as recommended by the installation manual, but I'm&nbsp;suspicious about this configuration (it's effectively pulling in&nbsp;air being expelled by the video card below) - my guess is in&nbsp;winter this is probably a good/OK config, but with higher ambient&nbsp;temperatures (summer), it's going to perform much worse then the&nbsp;reverse of pushing hot air out of the case... I will need to do&nbsp;some testing to see though, the 600T has some nice air flow<br />
characteristics.</li></p>
<li>HP ZR30w would only display at 1280x800 using the DVI&nbsp;dual-link cable, switching to using display port instead resolved&nbsp;this issue... looking around the web, seems like I'm not the only&nbsp;one to have this issue with this panel... I have to say that from a reliability/build quality/connectivity point of view the Dell 30" panel beats my other 2 hands down, but I think the Samsung and the HP panels both have better images (slightly).</li><br />
</ul><br />
The new machine scores a 7.8, which is pretty standard these days&nbsp;with a good SSD, and I currently have it overclocked at 4600mhz&nbsp;(46.0 x 100) - but haven't had much of a chance to mess with&nbsp;voltages and see if I could push it further.</p>
<h2>Real-world performance</h2><br />
The main project I work on these days is a fairly large .Net code&nbsp;base, it currently consists of about 70 projects and around 3,500&nbsp;*.cs files - I did some quick stopwatch tests to see how much&nbsp;faster things are on the new machine:</p>

<td valign="top" width="132">15 seconds</td><br />
</tr><br />
</tbody><br />
</table><br />
Those last 2 figures are the "money shot" for me... and these are&nbsp;for single-threaded VS builds, if using msbuild with the parallel&nbsp;option I suspect the build time would be much lower still.</p>
<h2>Working Environment</h2><br />
So here's my current development environment - 2 x 30" Panels<br />
(5120x1600) + 15.4" Laptop (with Synergy), new and old machines<br />
currently both sitting under my desk, and my ever trusty G15&nbsp;Keyboard and Logitech Performance Mouse M950 (Darkfield) mouse. &nbsp;Note: After writing this I did add a third 30" panel and moved away from using a corner Desk - I'll post an update to this shortly.</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2><br />
I'm a happy camper with this new machine, and I'm looking forward&nbsp;to seeing what may &nbsp;come in Q2 onwards next year with regards to&nbsp;motherboards (dual processor / more memory options).?</p>
<p>Also a quick hat-tip to <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com">Jeff @ coding horror</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2011/07/building-a-pc-part-vii-rebooting.html">his post</a> pointed me to the fix for the&nbsp;suspend issue I was having, the post made for interesting reading&nbsp;seeing as it was a very similar spec to my own machine.</p>
<p>Next thing I will be looking at is seeing if I can reduce VS2010&nbsp;build times still further through some tweaks to our setup, as&nbsp;per <a href="http://blogs.microsoft.co.il/blogs/arik/archive/2011/05/17/speed-up-visual-studio-builds.aspx">this post by Arik Poznanski</a>.</p>
