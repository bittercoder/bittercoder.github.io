    Confirmed, it's 1pm to 3:30pm - thanks for the spotting that too, the page has now been updated.

    Cheers,

<p>As mentioned on both <a href="http:&#47;&#47;blogs.msdn.com&#47;darrylburling&#47;archive&#47;2007&#47;12&#47;10&#47;2008-summer-road-trip-register-now.aspx">Darryl's<&#47;a> and <a href="http:&#47;&#47;turtle.net.nz&#47;blog&#47;post&#47;SummerRoadTrip2008">JB's<&#47;a> blogs&nbsp;- in February of next year <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.syringe.net.nz&#47;">Chris<&#47;a>, <a href="http:&#47;&#47;blogs.msdn.com&#47;darrylburling&#47;">Darryl<&#47;a> &amp; <a href="http:&#47;&#47;turtle.net.nz&#47;blog&#47;default.aspx">JB<&#47;a> will be touring&nbsp;around New Zealand to tell you all about "2008" (SQL 2K8, VS.NET&nbsp;2K8 &amp; Windows 2K8 that is) and they're getting "locals" to&nbsp;participate in the various centers, and I just happen to be that&nbsp;"Local" for Auckland, though hopefully not too "<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.bbcresources.com&#47;images&#47;costume&#47;late_20th&#47;the_league_of_gentlemen_PU.jpg">Local<&#47;a>".</p>
<p>So either follow the links above for the full announcement of&nbsp;centers and dates, or if you are local to Auckland then just click&nbsp;on the following link and <a href="http:&#47;&#47;aucklandroadtrip08.events.live.com&#47;default.aspx">sign&nbsp;yourself up<&#47;a> for the session on Monday February 4th - it's also&nbsp;worth noting that if you both register and turn up (I believe you&nbsp;have to do both ;o) you go into the draw for one of 3 home&nbsp;servers... education and swag.</p>
<p>It should be a lot of fun, so register and come along next&nbsp;year!</p>
<p><strong>Edit:<&#47;strong> just noticed Chris has also &nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.syringe.net.nz&#47;2007&#47;12&#47;10&#47;WereAllGoingOnASummerHolidayWellKinda.aspx">posted<&#47;a>, and included some extra details - so take a look!</p>
