    Confirmed, it's 1pm to 3:30pm - thanks for the spotting that too, the page has now been updated.

    Cheers,

<p>As mentioned on both <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/darrylburling/archive/2007/12/10/2008-summer-road-trip-register-now.aspx">Darryl's</a> and <a href="http://turtle.net.nz/blog/post/SummerRoadTrip2008">JB's</a> blogs&nbsp;- in February of next year <a href="http://www.syringe.net.nz/">Chris</a>, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/darrylburling/">Darryl</a> &amp; <a href="http://turtle.net.nz/blog/default.aspx">JB</a> will be touring&nbsp;around New Zealand to tell you all about "2008" (SQL 2K8, VS.NET&nbsp;2K8 &amp; Windows 2K8 that is) and they're getting "locals" to&nbsp;participate in the various centers, and I just happen to be that&nbsp;"Local" for Auckland, though hopefully not too "<a href="http://www.bbcresources.com/images/costume/late_20th/the_league_of_gentlemen_PU.jpg">Local</a>".</p>
<p>So either follow the links above for the full announcement of&nbsp;centers and dates, or if you are local to Auckland then just click&nbsp;on the following link and <a href="http://aucklandroadtrip08.events.live.com/default.aspx">sign&nbsp;yourself up</a> for the session on Monday February 4th - it's also&nbsp;worth noting that if you both register and turn up (I believe you&nbsp;have to do both ;o) you go into the draw for one of 3 home&nbsp;servers... education and swag.</p>
<p>It should be a lot of fun, so register and come along next&nbsp;year!</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> just noticed Chris has also &nbsp;<a href="http://www.syringe.net.nz/2007/12/10/WereAllGoingOnASummerHolidayWellKinda.aspx">posted</a>, and included some extra details - so take a look!</p>
