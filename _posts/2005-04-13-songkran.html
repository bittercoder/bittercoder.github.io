    working people can't really enjoy it.

  Well what can I say... this place is amazing (at this time of<br />
  year), Songkran, is without a doubt, the most friendly and<br />
  pleasant festival ever -... I'm absoloutely soaked from head to<br />
  foot and just sat my big black 45 baht bucket-with-string next to<br />
  me in the internet cafe - brilliant, I cant really describe the<br />
  atmosphere here, but I wish we had anywhere near as much fun and<br />
  energy on a public holiday at home.<br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>
  At any rate, lets cover what I've been up to... My trek for 3<br />
  days was really fun - my first night in Chiang Mai I met 2 of my<br />
  fellow trekers, A girl from Finland (Anna) and a guy from England<br />
  (Paul) - Paul is great, a very very interesting fellow who in his<br />
  30 years has a great deal of life experiences to share, not all<br />
  of them pleasant, but all the more interesting... Anna has a<br />
  wonderful command of the english language, and has studied<br />
  psychology and is a transient..and vid people watcher (like<br />
  myself) - so we get on quite well, we even got up to a bit of<br />
  drunken urban exploration as we wandered home last night.<br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>
  First night of the trek we headed out and stayed a night with a<br />
  Karren (sp?) hill tribe - they dont speak standard Thai in these<br />
  regions, and as part of the "eco" tourism push they have been<br />
  oddly converted (no feed lines, but the tribes have solar panels,<br />
  T.V. aerials and catholic churches - catholicism in Thailand is<br />
  very interesting, I still haven't quite got the "measure" of it,<br />
  as they still celebrate budhist events such as Songkran and<br />
  generally are a little.. umm.. Odd.&nbsp; Missionaries have a bit<br />
  of answer for ;o)<br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>
  Second night we headed to a little village that had a waterfall,<br />
  very scenic... just kicking back and having a few drinks with our<br />
  trainee guide, Mr Bad Boy.. who's birthday apparently it was, but<br />
  wether it was true we're not quite sure.&nbsp; Mr Ken (our main<br />
  guide), was hungover (among other things... hehe) from the night<br />
  before and let us be.<br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>
  The last day we went bamboo rafting (and it was the first proper<br />
  day of Songkran) so we got very wet.. and then went for a half<br />
  hour ride on elephants at the elephant camp, which was definitely<br />
  an experience.. riding on an elephant is really quite something,<br />
  especially when they start scrambling up an eighty degree<br />
  incline..<br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>
  My Trek was great, but the variety and amusement derived from the<br />
  people I met on the trek was even better - the social dynamics<br />
  are hilarious (the group consisted of a bunch of british girls<br />
  ranging from 18 through 22 and one english lad (Tom) who had been<br />
  teaching english in Thailand for the last 3 months, 2 Australians<br />
  (both pretty cool), Paul, Anna and Myself being the solo<br />
  travellers.&nbsp; I can't really be bother putting it down into<br />
  words right now, but it's been a lot of fun, and the food was<br />
  great.<br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>
  Today I had a lazy start, as we went out to the riverside bar and<br />
  grill for drinks and food last night and I was felling a little<br />
  run down (Honey coated pork spare ribs with spicey papaya salad<br />
  with prawns and a 2 litre pitcher of chang beer, so good!) - so I<br />
  had breakfast at 10:30 then read a book till 12 (Trigger by<br />
  Arthur.C.Clarke, which isn't a bad load of bollix) - and went<br />
  wandering with Paul.<br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>
  Since then I've just been getting sprayed with water by kids and<br />
  old people alike (it's good luck to wet westerners :) almost<br />
  continually... there are people everywhere, and they're all<br />
  smiling... it's&nbsp;just amazing - you really have to be here to<br />
  understand, but you're very greatful for your Typhoid<br />
  shot!!&nbsp; Everything is covered in the local water out of the<br />
  ping river and surrounding areas, deli belly central I'm sure...<br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>
  Tonight I'm meeting up for drinks with the Trek'ing gang again at<br />
  8pm, which should be fun - I have the advantage of not really<br />
  having plans till after Songkran, so I can have a bit of a fun<br />
  without worrying about needing to move again the next day.<br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>
  Once Songkran is over I'll book a thai cooking class for a couple<br />
  of days and arrange my slow boat to Luang Prabang in Laos (I've<br />
  already got my Visa being processed now) - and I take back what I<br />
  said about Chiang Mai weather, it's miles better then Bangkok<br />
  because the nights are a lovely 20 degrees.. just dont get out of<br />
  bed till lunch time and you have a 5 hours heat and then the<br />
  temperature eases off, I actually wore a pair of jeans last night<br />
  comfortably.. first time in Thailand.<br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>
  Hope everyones doing swell, whats the weather back home like :?<br />
