<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>Just a quick update re: the next Architecture Chat.</p>
<p>Last weeks chat didn't go ahead because I was overseas on leave,&nbsp;and unfortunately on my way home I picked up a dose of some mega&nbsp;flu which is knocking me around something fierce - apparently it's&nbsp;not of the swine variety, but I'm starting to wonder...</p>
<p>At any rate, rather then unleash it upon everyone else I'll hold&nbsp;off setting up another chat until I've recovered - so I suspect&nbsp;that'll mean Thursday next week, 16th July.</p>
<p>If you have any topic suggestions for next week, just leave a&nbsp;comment on this post, flick me an email or message me on <a href="http://twitter.com/bittercoder">twitter</a>.&nbsp; Look forward to&nbsp;seeing you all then.</p>
