<p>Just a quick note - we were due to have an Architecture chat this&nbsp;Thursday, but I'm a little snowed under - so I'm going to&nbsp;postpone it until the following Thursday (22nd July 11:30am,&nbsp;Garrisons, Sylvia Park).</p>
<p>We are collecting topics on this <a href="https:&#47;&#47;wave.google.com&#47;wave&#47;?pli=1#restored:wave:googlewave.com%252Fw%252BFf8OQ57LA.1">wave<&#47;a> - feel free to post suggestions on google wave, via&nbsp;email or on twitter with the hashtag #ArchitectureChat.</p>
<p>See you all next week!</p>
<p>- Alex</p>
