  content: How dare she met Tom Waits, I'll not have you hanging out with disreputable
    people like that. I went for a walk last Saturday night and ended up listening
    to a bit of Tom while sitting in town. Very surreal and quite amusing, picked  my
    mood up just like that.

<p><strong>Phonsavan</strong></p>
<p>A mere 8 hour bus journey from Luang Prabang on some of the&nbsp;windiest roads I've encountered so far on my travels, and I&nbsp;arrived at the rather... umm.. Arid town of Phonsavan... Why had&nbsp;I come here?</p>
<p>Well... to see the plain of Jars of course!</p>
<p>At any rate, after the 8 hour bus ride and chilling to various&nbsp;sounds (I was feeling a little mute, so I cranked up some Neutral&nbsp;Milk Hotel and followed it up with some Jean Grae - I really seem&nbsp;to be growing fond of her hip hop while on holiday... mmmm) we<br>
arrived at the Phonsavan bus station, I quickly got friendly with&nbsp;2 people.. A Lady Charlotte, Social worker from London (who I'm&nbsp;stilling hanging out with) and Pierce, a fun almost-uni-student&nbsp;from the UK as well.</p>
<p>We all ended up heading to the Khong Kheo guesthouse (I Think&nbsp;that was it's name, near the old runway) - and then after&nbsp;securing some rooms we went out to explore the town... of which&nbsp;there wasn't much, eventually having some beers and shooting the&nbsp;breeze - after that we went in search of a Meal, originally we&nbsp;had decided to find the Lao Youth Centre Restaurant, or something&nbsp;along those lines.. which took a while, but we eventually&nbsp;discovered it, though it's now called the New Wave (opposite the&nbsp;Maly hotel) ... sat down, got menus, went to order and was told&nbsp;they only had sticky rice... hmm... so we went across the road to&nbsp;the Maly (best food in town it says on the door, which I think&nbsp;was actually accurate - which also has a nice display of weaponry&nbsp;on the wall, actually everywhere has a nice display of weaponry&nbsp;on the wall in Phonsavan..heh).</p>
<p>At any rate, the following day we were up at 9am to do a day of&nbsp;touring the plain of Jars (sites 1, 2 and 3) - our guide/trip&nbsp;wasn't cheap ($8 US each) - but I think in the end it was<br>
probably worth it because his interest in the sites and the Laos&nbsp;war was wonderful, and I learnt a great deal - the day started&nbsp;off with a visit to the quite large market in Phonsavan (well&nbsp;worth a look all on it's own) - followed by a visit to a derelict&nbsp;russian tank, then site 3, site 2 (with lunch) and site 1 - site&nbsp;1 being the biggest.&nbsp; In all there are 60 jar sites known to&nbsp;locals, and 50 documented so far by UNESCO.</p>
<p>The jars themselves are a bit of a mystery, but dating puts them&nbsp;at around 2,500 years old - far longer then the Laos people have&nbsp;been occupying Laos - and each one is cut from solid stone, some&nbsp;with lids, and weighing up to 2 tonnes - and dates back to the<br>
early stone age of the original south east asian people in this&nbsp;region.&nbsp; I dont think you could describe it as an exciting&nbsp;place, but it's definitely quite surreal to think of just how old<br>
they are and to see them rising out of the ground like monaliths&nbsp;- a Laos stone henge.</p>
<p>The really interesting thing is that this is also a hot spot of&nbsp;the secret war in Laos (Laos being the most bombed country in the&nbsp;world, aproximately 3 million bombs dropped over a 10 year period&nbsp;AFAIK) - and in site 3 was the situation for a large&nbsp;revolutionary camp, where various Vietkong troops and supplies&nbsp;were smuggled from Vietnam.&nbsp; Bomb craters are everywhere and&nbsp;UxO is a major problem, the MAG (Munitions/Mine Action Group) has<br>
done a lot of work (supported by nzaid no less..) to make safe&nbsp;paths to the various jars - and it's depressing to think of the&nbsp;damage done to this truely unique site during that conflict.</p>
<p><strong>Vientiane</strong></p>
<p>The following day I left Phonsavan, originally I had planned to&nbsp;go to Vang Vieng - but after to talking to some people I didn't&nbsp;really feel like it - for some odd reason I was in the mood for a&nbsp;city - so I skipped and got a bus straight to Vientiane. &nbsp;The bus ride was quite comfy, I took VIP - which has more leg&nbsp;room and you get a free drink of water and biscuits, at the cost&nbsp;of another $1 US.&nbsp; The ride was uneventful, accept for a&nbsp;flat tire and that one of the support crew for the bus driver&nbsp;carried a Kalashnikov with him everywhere he went, at one point&nbsp;the barrel was resting on the back of my seat (Though I didn't&nbsp;know).. which would've been OK till an Israeli guy pointed out&nbsp;that they've got a notoriously ineffective safety.. erk - while&nbsp;changing a tire he just left it lying on the ground outside where&nbsp;I could've just picked it up... Laos does have a bit of a banana&nbsp;republic feel at times - you just have to keep on smiling ;o)</p>
<p>Vientiane is pretty cool - the decaying french colonial&nbsp;architecture is eerily beautiful, combined with the dusty roads&nbsp;and really good french food.. I'm splurging while here on a very&nbsp;nice room, with Aircon and T.V! Which is costing a whopping $12&nbsp;US a night, sometimes it's nice to remind myself that I'm not a</p>
<p>"scratching to stay alive" backpacker ;o) but a lazy overpaid&nbsp;software developer after all.</p>
<p>The food here is great - and expensive for Laos - but still&nbsp;bloody cheap for home and of equivalent if not better quality -&nbsp;dinner with Charlotte last night was a big ice cream sundae (3&nbsp;big scoops of Rum &amp; Raisin).. a really nice Carbonara pasta&nbsp;and a couple of big bottles of beer.. for approximately $9 NZ...&nbsp;not too shabby.&nbsp; I discovered that she's met Tom Waits in&nbsp;person, and seen him in concert - I'm rather jealous!</p>
<p>Probably the funiest thing today was heading to Patuxai, a large&nbsp;concrete monument that is very reminiscent of the Arc De Triomphe&nbsp;n Paris.. It was built in the 1960's with United states purchased&nbsp;cement that was supposed to have been used to construct a new<br>
airport..&nbsp; I wonder what the states thought of that ;o) Also interesting (and Just by the arch) are 2 rather large fountains, which are sychronised to funky Thai and Laos music</p>
<p>that plays in the background - they're pretty cool, and donated&nbsp;by the Chinese government - In fact everything in this country&nbsp;that looks new appears to have been donated by some foreign&nbsp;government, even on the outskirts of town Japan is funding the<br>
construction of a weather radar station. Yet just like China most people don't have clean water. On the down side today I went to apply for my Cambodian visa,</p>
<p>however it's bloody labour day here - and everything was&nbsp;closed... so I'll have to do it tomorrow, hopefully it can be&nbsp;processed quickly as it would be a shame to burn up too many days&nbsp;here, apparently it can take 3 days (ugh!) - though you may be&nbsp;able to convince them to do it on the spot.. so I might need to&nbsp;do some sweet talking or attempt my first bribe (I was silly not&nbsp;to get it done while in Chiang Mai, when I got my Laos Visa...&nbsp;only takes 1 day to do it in Thailand.. meh)</p>
<p>At any rate, I'll probably post some pictures next time I update&nbsp;with what I've been snapping lately and talk about my adventures&nbsp;with the Cambodian embassy.</p>
<p>Cheers...</p>
<p>Alex</p>
