    There definitely is some NIH syndrome going on... but in this case I think it's unavoidable... your options are "no codplex" or "codeplex with TFS"... and TFS brings it's own twist on matters - and so Codeplex ends up playing "catch up" ... and catching up to source forge... well there's a bit of work to be done there, they've got a huge head start... And who said Microsoft want to catch up, they're not really interested in hosting all open source projects, just ones for their products and platforms :P

    I expect Codeplex to innovate in some small areas (web services could be one for instance...) but over all it will be feature-poor compared to it's competitors... but it will be incrementally improved, and I think major stumbling blocks will be tackled first, because of the approach to development (implement features with the most votes first).

    And let's not forget gotdotnet... that thing was crap from the beginning, and after TFS was released they couldn't ignore replacing gotdotnet's own SCM implementation with TFS... so is Codeplex better then just revamping gotdotnet... yes, absolutely!

    I'm not aiming to be a strong supporter of Codeplex... I just think it will suck less and less over time, and will suit some people already who aren't comfortable with the more open environment offered by other OSS hosts (read: morts who wouldn't even be able to use TortoiseSVN, or setup a mediawiki on their sourceforge website).

<p>In a follow up to this &nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;feeds.feedburner.com&#47;%7Er&#47;BitterCoder&#47;%7E3&#47;104888571&#47;PermaLink,guid,ea8c4d28-40b5-42ef-88ce-c08a1c6033d3.aspx">post<&#47;a> I made yesterday, it seems some people are annoyed that a&nbsp;Codeplex command line client exists at all...</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http:&#47;&#47;macournoyer.wordpress.com&#47;2007&#47;03&#47;28&#47;microsoft-re-reinventing-the-wheel-again-bis&#47;">Microsoft re-inventing the wheel<&#47;a><&#47;li>
<li><a href="http:&#47;&#47;ryepup.unwashedmeme.com&#47;blog&#47;2007&#47;03&#47;27&#47;codeplex-wastes-six-months-reinventing-wheels&#47;">Codeplex wastes six months reinventing wheels<&#47;a><&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
I still can not help but feel some people are missing the&nbsp;point of Codeplex all together... as I see it (and these are only&nbsp;my opinions on the matter) - Codeplex:</p>
<ul>
<li>Supersedes the aging gotdotnet.<&#47;li>
<li>Demonstrates TFS features<&#47;li>
<li style="list-style: none; display: inline;">
<ul>
<li>Scalability for high volumes of users (not necessarily&nbsp;usability, but they're working on that)<&#47;li>
<li>Case study for any large organizations considering&nbsp;deploying it across their organization.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
<&#47;li></p>
<li>Provides a place Microsoft can.<&#47;li>
<li style="list-style: none; display: inline;">
<ul>
<li>Host open-source projects for life.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Control<&#47;span> and&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">support<&#47;span> the&nbsp;environment.<&#47;li>
<li>Keep a single message across their organization - we use&nbsp;TFS for source control from now on.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
<em>(At this point it's worth noting I'm a SVN&#47;Trac&#47;CC.Net guy&nbsp;myself... I can't actually justify the expenses of TFS at the&nbsp;moment)<&#47;em></p>
<p>For me the reasons to use codeplex over another open source&nbsp;provider are simply:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's different &#47; new.<&#47;li>
<li>It has a strong Microsoft &#47; .Net focus.<&#47;li>
<li>It's easier to get going for a newbie .Net developer&nbsp;(integrated source control in VS.Net, simple wiki pages&nbsp;baked-in)<&#47;li>
<li>You can play with TFS.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
They are reasons, but hardly "compelling" ones ;o)</p>
<p>The beta command line client is a good thing, but to counter that&nbsp;"6 months wasted effort" with a call to replace TFS with subversion&nbsp;in Codeplex ... that just seems counter-intuitive to me... suddenly&nbsp;you have a roll-on effect of zero integration between source&nbsp;control and the in-built issue tracking mechanisms... so what, lets&nbsp;replace that with Trac??... and now that comes with it's own&nbsp;wiki... so ditch the existing one... and suddenly Codeplex is&nbsp;nothing more then a shell for managing file releases with some&nbsp;forums.</p>
<p>What kind of message would it send to microsoft customers who have&nbsp;invested time and effort into team system... let's be reasonable,&nbsp;it's just not going to happen, so whats the next logical step...&nbsp;improve the tooling to work with the existing source control&nbsp;solution... first step to achieving that... build a decent command&nbsp;line client!</p>
<p>So... if you are looking for subversion based hosting why not use&nbsp;well established players who have been supporting open source from&nbsp;the beginning like <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.sourceforge.net&#47;">SourceForge<&#47;a> or <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.tigris.org&#47;">tigris<&#47;a>... don't they still deserve&nbsp;your love now more then ever since Codeplex is on the scene... what&nbsp;better way to vote than with your choice of OSS project&nbsp;hosting?</p>
<p>Codeplex is an alternative, not a replacement, for the likes of&nbsp;Sourceforge... perhaps what we need is a OssHostMatrix, much like&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.wikimatrix.org&#47;">WikiMatrix<&#47;a> that compares<br />
feature for feature so you can pick the host that's appropriate to&nbsp;your project on features alone, rather then bitching about what's&nbsp;missing in Codeplex, when it's freely available elsewhere...</p>
<p>I'm starting to feel sorry for some of the codeplex guys (like</p>
<p>Jonathan Wanagel, who I commend for being vocal about what's going&nbsp;on at codeplex... he seems to pop up on a lot of blogs I read) ...&nbsp;they certainly do seem a little damned if you, damned if you don't&nbsp;at the moment - especially when progress is slowly being made and&nbsp;demonstrated.</p>
