    Hi Bruce,

    I'm a IoC evangelist from way back - so it was more an observation then a criticism that Windsor was being used to handle wiring up the various services - I'm certainly using my own library via a container, mostly to wire up the appropriate token/user etc. repositories, and so I can apply cross cutting concerns for logging, instrumentation of OAuth requests etc.

    I suspect seeing as both libraries were built with IoC in mind it probably wouldn't be too hard to build adapters to use services from one library in the other - certainly once abstractions exist to reduce the tight coupling with System.Web mechanics like HttpRequest - so that common points of difference like token and nonce validation schemes etc. could be used with either library.

<p>You may recall a few months back I released an &nbsp;<a href="http://blog.bittercoder.com/PermaLink,guid,a7ec7a4d-1d33-418a-8649-21fe8aa420fe.aspx">OAuth library for .Net</a> (which can be found <a href="http://code.google.com/p/devdefined-tools/wiki/OAuth">here on&nbsp;google code</a>) - at the time of writing that library the only&nbsp;other OAuth "solution" for .Net developers was a C# file containing&nbsp;some simple helper functions, that didn't even produce valid&nbsp;results in many cases, and the rather basic implementation as part&nbsp;of the restful chess/myspace example.</p>
<p>Well the guys at <a href="http://www.madgex.com/">Madgex</a> in the&nbsp;UK have now released their own OAuth.Net library.. for more details&nbsp;you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check out <a href="http://siliconbea.ch/technology/dot-net/2008-09-05/bringing-oauth-to-dot-net-developers/">Bruce Boughton's post</a> on their initial release.</li>
<li>Get some more details on the <a href="http://lab.madgex.com/oauth-net/">Madgex lab page</a> here.</li>
<li>And of course <a href="http://code.google.com/p/oauth-dot-net/">grab the code</a> from&nbsp;here.</li><br />
</ul><br />
As for differences between the two implementations... from a&nbsp;50K foot glance.</p>
<ul>
<li>There's a dependency on the Windsor container when using the&nbsp;Madgex library (if you want to use it's out the box&nbsp;implementation / configuration examples etc.)</li>
<li>The Madgex library includes a http module for making a&nbsp;provider implementation easier when building web apps.</li>
<li>The madgex library appears to take a harder dependency on&nbsp;HttpRequest then the DevDefined library (but that's just a hunch,&nbsp;saw it in a few interface definitions, rather then some wrapper&nbsp;equivalent).</li>
<li>The madgex library looks a little more polished (i.e. xml&nbsp;docs) and has a configuration section.</li>
<li>The Madgex library features some niceities like Sliding&nbsp;window validation support (i.e. they only allow messages to be&nbsp;supplied where the timestamp falls within a certain time window&nbsp;of the server, and keep the list of previous nonces only for the<br />
period of that window - flushing nonces that are not longer&nbsp;required via a background thread - saving on the volume of nonces&nbsp;to record i.e. for replay attacks).&nbsp; Of course it's an&nbsp;in-memory solution, so not suited to farms, but still cool.</li></p>
<li>Slightly less fluent consumer implementation, I prefer my&nbsp;libraries consumer implementation, but of course that's just me&nbsp;:P</li>
<li>Both libraries are under the MIT license.</li><br />
</ul><br />
All said and done it's a very sound effort, great work guys!</p>
<p>And it's awesome to have some choice emerging in this space.</p>
