<p>Architecture chat tomorrow at 11:30am... I'm going to leave it&nbsp;fairly open for topics so all come along with something interesting&nbsp;to say ;o) ... or leave a comment on this post if you'd like to&nbsp;give me or anyone else a heads up on what you'd like to talk&nbsp;about.</p>
<p>Some things I'd personally be interested:</p>
<ul>
<li>Auckland recruitment environment.<&#47;li>
<li>Must read books for both new and seasoned developers alike.<&#47;li>
<li>Implementing code that can explain itself - for example&nbsp;security mechanisms able to explain (in English) why you do or do&nbsp;not have access, DSL's that give meaningful reasons for the&nbsp;decisions made, and how to flow those messages through the&nbsp;context of operations etc.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
All are welcome - drop me an email if you're a new comer and&nbsp;we'll keep an eye out for you!</p>
<p>Information regarding the location and previous chat write-ups can&nbsp;be found <a href="http:&#47;&#47;wiki.bittercoder.com&#47;SylviaParkArchitectureChats.ashx">here<&#47;a>.</p>
