<p>Well I'm back in Luang Prabang today, arrived yesterday&nbsp;afternoon, planning to head to Phonsavan tomorrow to go see the&nbsp;plain of Jars.</p>
<p>Originally I had planned to head south earlier, but after talking&nbsp;to some people coming from the north (and seeing their pictures)&nbsp;I decided to head to Muang Ngoi Neua with Hayley and Pauline (A&nbsp;dutch lady I met on the slow boat).</p>
<p>To get to Muang Ngoi we took a 4 hour bus ride to Nong Khiaw,&nbsp;then jumped on a boat for a 1 hour ride up to the village - there&nbsp;are no roads leading to this village you see - the boat ride was&nbsp;spectacular as we plied our way upstream through little sets of&nbsp;rapids between the mightly limestone peaks.</p>
<p>Once arriving at Muang Ngoi we headed to the quiet end of town&nbsp;and rented some Bungalows, mine cost $1 US per night, for a&nbsp;double bed and a couple of hammocks outside on my deck - all very&nbsp;pleasant.&nbsp; For the first day I pretty much just drank some&nbsp;Laos tea and slept in the hammock while the sun went down,&nbsp;finishing off a book (Titan, which has a daft ending IMO..).</p>
<p>That night we had quite a violent storm (loads of fork and sheet&nbsp;lightening) which was amazing to watch - thankfully my bungalow&nbsp;stayed upright ;o)</p>
<p>Second day we got up and went on a bit of a Trek, first to some&nbsp;nearby caves, and then off to the Huay Bo, about an hours walk&nbsp;away which is of mixed Laos and Khamu village people.&nbsp; It&nbsp;was here that we got befriended by a man who runs the local&nbsp;guesthouse and I ended up sampling 5 or 6 shots of his home&nbsp;brewed Laos Laos... which was surprisingly clean compared to the&nbsp;crap we drank on the slow boat.. though&nbsp;it was still&nbsp;painful.</p>
<p>After this we headed back to the village, chilled out and had&nbsp;some dinner.</p>
<p>Third day was lazy... a little more reading, I'm onto "American&nbsp;Psycho" - not something I'd normally read, but It was recommended&nbsp;to me by Charlotte, so I thought I'd give it a go - so far it's&nbsp;been pretty funny. This day I got a really dodgy stomach, cramps,&nbsp;the whole shebang... not sure what I've eat that's caused it -&nbsp;but it's no fun - didn't sleep at all.</p>
<p>Fourth day I got the 9:30 boat back to Nong Khiaw, then took a&nbsp;jumbo truck (basically a small truck with 2 bench seats running&nbsp;down either side of the back tray) - which was not the most fun&nbsp;I've ever had - back to Luang Prabang, and&nbsp;got myself a $8US&nbsp;(extravagance!) guesthouse room with own bathroom, where I'll&nbsp;stay till I feel better.</p>
<p>Fifth day (today) - feeling a bit better, will travel to&nbsp;Phonsavan tomorrow morning unless I feel really sick again -&nbsp;though I can probably counter that with the magical "Imodium".&nbsp;anyway, here are some pictures:</p>

<p>The local dock at Muang Ngoi, the roofed boats are what they&nbsp;stuff 20 people into when negotiating the rapids up/down stream.</p>

<p>The view from my Hammock - not too shabby.</p>
