    Hey Alex, amazing photos (again), can't imagine what it must be like actually being there and seeing it all first hand. Some of the architecture is gorgeous, if a little misplaced. Very envious of you anyway, although not so much of your visit to the killing fields, all very upsetting and whatnot, even just reading about it. Must be one helluva experience though.

    Keep meaning to email you but we are both complete slackers. Hope you're feeling a bit better. Pity us here back home doing absolutely nothing of interest (unless you count stripping wallpaper and polyurethaning floors... Oh, and trying not to kill your neices). Haha. Keep us all updated, hope you're still having an awesome time :o)

Well seeing as I'm taking it "easy" today after my abortionary visit to the Angkor temples yesterday (read about it in my next post)&nbsp;and waiting for my Antibiotics to kick in&nbsp;I thought it was about time to post some more pictures.. so here goes:<br />
</p></p>
<p>
  <img src="http://blog.bittercoder.com/content/binary/plain_of_jars.JPG" /><br />
</p></p>
<p>
  The plain of Jars near Phonsavan, Laos - all I can say is It's more impressive in person ;o)<br />
</p></p>
<p>
  <img src="http://blog.bittercoder.com/content/binary/gun_bus_laos.JPG" /><br />
</p></p>
<p>
While leaning out the bus window we get to see one of the bus staff attending to a flat tire in Laos, obviously a gun is an important tool in this process...<br />
</p></p>
<p>
  <img src="http://blog.bittercoder.com/content/binary/arsenal.JPG" /><br />
</p></p>
<p>
The "arsenal" on display in a restaurant in Phonsavan, just about every establishment had a similar display... much like a New Zealand beach bach has 70's decor.<br />
</p></p>
<p>
  <img  src="http://blog.bittercoder.com/content/binary/vientiane.JPG" /><br />
</p></p>
<p>
The faux Arche de triumphe made with misappropriated concrete for a new airport in Vientiane.&nbsp; Compare it to the original structure here&nbsp;<a href="http://www.caingram.info/Worldwide/Pic_htm/paris_1.htm">http://www.caingram.info/Worldwide/Pic_htm/paris_1.htm</a>&nbsp;if you feel so inclined)<br />
</p></p>
<p>
  <img src="http://blog.bittercoder.com/content/binary/wat_phu_champasak.JPG" /><br />
</p></p>
<p>
  Looking down on the lower levels of Wat Phu Champasak, near Champasak/Pakse in Laos.&nbsp; These structures are known to be older then Angkor Wat.<br />
</p></p>
<p>
  <img src="http://blog.bittercoder.com/content/binary/wat_phu_champasak2.JPG" /><br />
</p></p>
<p>
  More Wat Phu Champasak goodness...<br />
</p></p>
<p>
  <img src="http://blog.bittercoder.com/content/binary/car_ferry1.JPG" /><br />
</p></p>
<p>
  The vehicle ferrys in Laos&nbsp;- basically a narrow boat with two "outriggers" and vehicles moving on/off it side-on.<br />
</p></p>
<p>
  <img src="http://blog.bittercoder.com/content/binary/car_ferry2.JPG" /><br />
</p></p>
<p>
  Though hard to see, the wheel just has rope wraped round it a couple of times that then travels inside the hull to the back rudder... rough as guts ;o)<br />
</p></p>
<p>
  <img src="http://blog.bittercoder.com/content/binary/decaying_french_colonial_influence.JPG" /><br />
</p></p>
<p>
  One of the nicer examples of decaying colonial architecture in Phnom Penh.<br />
</p></p>
<p>
  <img  src="http://blog.bittercoder.com/content/binary/child_tree.JPG" /><br />
</p></p>
<p>
  Mmmm... what can you say? A sign at the killing fields.<br />
</p></p>
<p>
  <img src="http://blog.bittercoder.com/content/binary/bones.JPG" /><br />
</p></p>
<p>
  Urns of bones, At the killing fields.<br />
</p></p>
<p>
  <img src="http://blog.bittercoder.com/content/binary/faces1.JPG" /><br />
</p></p>
<p>
  Some of the 'mug shots' of people brought to S-21 - there are walls and walls of these, a number of the people had minor birth defects or medical conditions which were evident in the pictures.&nbsp;People with spectacles were prime targets.. as was anyone of a high level of education.<br />
</p></p>
<p>
  <img src="http://blog.bittercoder.com/content/binary/faces2.JPG" /><br />
</p></p>
<p>
  More of the same, this time as profile shots.<br />
</p></p>
<p>
  <img src="http://blog.bittercoder.com/content/binary/kiling_fields_stupa2.JPG" /><br />
</p></p>
<p>
  The stupa holding the skulls of people killed and burried in the mass graves of the killing fields - they leave the bottom level open so people can touch them, personally I thought that was a tad disrespectful... and I saw one Khmer man standing by looking quite upset while a tourist tapped on one of the skulls.<br />
</p></p>
<p>
  <img src="http://blog.bittercoder.com/content/binary/killing_fields_stupa.JPG" /><br />
</p></p>
<p>
  The Stupa, as seen from the outside - it's quite big.<br />
</p></p>
<p>
  <img src="http://blog.bittercoder.com/content/binary/s21_compound.JPG" /><br />
</p></p>
<p>
  I shot of building 'C' at S-21, the entire building is shrowded in barbed wire and full of small bricked up cells created inside the original class rooms.<br />
</p></p>
<p>
  <img src="http://blog.bittercoder.com/content/binary/wat_phnom_monkeys.JPG" /><br />
</p></p>
<p>
  The monkeys at Wat Phnom, Phnom Penh, Cambodia.<br />
</p></p>
<p>
  <img src="http://blog.bittercoder.com/content/binary/first_glimpse_of_angkor_wat.JPG" /><br />
</p></p>
<p>
  My first glimpse of Angkor Wat, as seen from a near by hill.<br />
</p></p>
<p>
  <img src="http://blog.bittercoder.com/content/binary/temples_at_sunset.JPG" /><br />
</p></p>
<p>
  Sunsets over ancient structures, always makes for a nice picture.<br />
</p></p>
