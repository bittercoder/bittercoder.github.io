<p><a href="http://www.catchlimited.com/">Catch Limited</a> (A NZ<br />
based consultancy) are currently performing an Industry wide survey<br />
on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_architecture">Enterprise<br />
Architecture</a> (not to be mistaken with Application<br />
Architecture), which includes questions on tools, frameworks and<br />
competencies of organisations throughout New Zealand and the World.</p>
<p>
  The survey itself can be found <a href="http://www.catchlimited.com/index.php?page=Architecture_Survey">here</a><br />
  (and has been localized for Chinese, German, Japanese and Spanish<br />
  speaking participants as well) - and by participating in the<br />
  survey you will receive a summary report of the survey results,<br />
  once they've collected all the results.<br />
</p></p>
<p>
  Of particular interest (to me at least) will be seeing what the<br />
  uptake of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_Architecture_framework">Enterprise<br />
  Architecture Frameworks</a> are around the world, and just what<br />
  frameworks organisations are selecting, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOGAF">TOGAF</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zachman_framework">Zachman</a>.<br />
  Additionally I'm keen to see what tools companies are using in<br />
  both NZ and the world, and what features of those tools are being<br />
  employed (useful information to those of us who like building<br />
  niche products or plug-ins for existing modelling tools and<br />
  frameworks, but aren't necessarily sure of market size etc.).<br />
</p></p>
<p>
  The survey takes about 10 or so minutes to complete (I did it<br />
  this morning) - and would be particularly relevant/interesting to<br />
  companies that employ an Enterprise Architecture Framework<br />
  already (or are thinking about employing one) - though there are<br />
  still plenty of questions relevant to organisations which do not<br />
  employ a framework at all, such as my own company!<br />
</p></p>
