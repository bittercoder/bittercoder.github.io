<p>So a quick observation on the alt.net conference list:<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
<span style="font-size: 11pt; color: rgb(31, 73, 125);">"You'll be<br />
happy to know then that in the new WPF Composite work we are doing,<br />
the DI&#47;IOC mechanism will be decoupled and pluggable. Actually the<br />
next version of Entlib will be the same. There's a new Dependency<br />
Injection block that will allow you to plug-in the container of<br />
your choice."<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><&#47;span>Which was <a href="http:&#47;&#47;tech.groups.yahoo.com&#47;group&#47;altnetconf&#47;message&#47;5215">posted<&#47;a><br />
on the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;tech.groups.yahoo.com&#47;group&#47;altnetconf&#47;">alt.net conference<br />
yahoo list<&#47;a> by by <a href="http:&#47;&#47;blogs.msdn.com&#47;gblock&#47;">Glen<br />
Block<&#47;a> from Microsoft.<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
I think this is very good news, at least for the WPF composite work<br />
they're doing - it might make it a great deal more appealing to me<br />
then the CAB was (I was never a big fan of the CAB because it<br />
didn't integrate well with the other stacks of technologies that<br />
made me productive).<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
I'm fairly ambivalent about the Enterprise Libraries upcoming<br />
pluggable IoC support however - surely the overlap between it and<br />
the facilities and services already provided by the IoC container<br />
you'd be plugging into would be great ... and IoC is only part of<br />
that story... for a number of common services (i.e. logging,<br />
transactions etc.) you're going to have create appropriate wrappers<br />
and sandwich things into the containers "abstracted" view of the<br />
world, or face tightly coupling your application to the Enterprise<br />
Library, I'm not sure there is much of a value proposition there...<br />
though I'm open to being educated if any P&amp;P Microsoft people<br />
happen to read this.<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
Interestingly enough <a href="http:&#47;&#47;vanryswyckjan.blogspot.com&#47;"><span class="post-author">Jan<br />
Van Ryswyck<&#47;span><&#47;a> has picked up on this slip from Glen and<br />
noted that it also implies Microsoft are writing yet another IoC<br />
container that will probably ship with EntLib &amp; the WPF<br />
composite work (in whatever shape it eventually takes) and they ask<br />
the question "<a href="http:&#47;&#47;vanryswyckjan.blogspot.com&#47;2007&#47;12&#47;why-o-why.html">why oh<br />
why!<&#47;a>" .<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
Personally I think it makes good sense to provide an out of the box<br />
IoC container, with it the product is far more accessible to new<br />
developers and people reviewing the technology - especially when<br />
you consider that:<br &#47;></p>
<ul>
<li>If support was added into say the Castle Windsor container,<br />
  it wouldn't see an official release until RC4 was made public -<br />
  and until then would be in a state of flux as part of the castle<br />
  trunk.<br />
  <&#47;li></p>
<li>People would expect Microsoft to "suggest" an OSS container<br />
  that works best with their offering - and playing favorites with<br />
  the .Net OSS community could only do harm to the ecology I feel.<br />
  <&#47;li></p>
<li>Microsoft retain consistency with their existing approach of<br />
  providing an entire stack of technologies for you to get the job<br />
  done, if that's what your like&#47;want or are told you<br />
  want.&nbsp;<br &#47;><br />
  <&#47;li></p>
<li>They can provide a set of consistent tutorials and training<br />
  materials for developers to "get up to speed" with for the<br />
  product, without having to provide umpteen alternative examples<br />
  for different containers, or explain why the container<br />
  terminology is slightly different to the product<br />
  terminology.<br &#47;><br />
  <&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul>So in short, I think it's a positive sign, not a negative one,<br />
even if another container is introduced into the mix - I'll be<br />
interested in seeing just how they do it (both the container, and<br />
the extension points to allow for plugging in a different<br />
container)... Though it could just be a hack using <a href="http:&#47;&#47;msdn2.microsoft.com&#47;en-us&#47;library&#47;system.iserviceprovider.aspx"><br />
IServiceProvider<&#47;a>, I wonder if perhaps they may need to go a bit<br />
further, so they can register services into the plugged in<br />
container with the appropriate lifestyle and configuration<br />
etc.<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
<b>Edit:<&#47;b> I just noticed <a href="http:&#47;&#47;ayende.com&#47;Blog&#47;archive&#47;2007&#47;12&#47;01&#47;Strategy-Provisioning-for-Application-Management-b.aspx"><br />
Ayende<&#47;a> posted about this as well...&nbsp; he seems pretty well<br />
aligned with the "why oh why" viewpoint, perhaps I'm missing<br />
something - but I just don't see it being all that practical in<br />
some scenarios to provide a product that wont work without the<br />
developer going through a separate selection process to pick an IoC<br />
container, if they don't already use one from the OSS<br />
community.<br &#47;></p>
