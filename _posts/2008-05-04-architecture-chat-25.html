<p>Small'ish turn out last Thursday.. but interesting discussions,&nbsp;including:</p>
<p>Hiring graduates - and what's more important, raw intellectual&nbsp;horse power or some demonstration of existing skills, the value of&nbsp;a bachelors vs. masters/honors degree... And how you can determine&nbsp;a candidates passion, and desperate lack of talent out there at the<br>
moment.</p>
<p>Discussed Database migrations - and different strategies for&nbsp;migrating (both data-centric and object-centric) and the missing&nbsp;database-agnostic "ETL" requirement for transforming data during a&nbsp;migration...</p>
<p>Database structure problems were discussed, i.e. legacy databases,&nbsp;and the problems they can present when attempting to work/map/scale&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>2D Barcodes also got a mention (i.e. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_Code">QR Code</a>) - including the&nbsp;Microsoft research project into high capacity <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/research/hccb/">color&nbsp;barcodes</a>.</p>
<p>The impedance mis-match between Amazon's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html?node=342335011">SimpleDB</a>&nbsp;and SQL Server, and how you can implement SimpleDB constructs in a&nbsp;SQL Database for testing etc.</p>
<p>Steganography got a bit of a mention - i.e. encrypting hidden&nbsp;messages into images, and how transformation/cropping tolerant you&nbsp;can make these processes.</p>
<p>I mentioned the <a href="http://www.albahari.com/nutshell/linqbridge.html">LinqBridge</a>&nbsp;project - which gives you access to Linq for objects in .Net&nbsp;Framework 2.0 projects.&nbsp; Great for those of us on projects&nbsp;which can't shift to 3.5 just yet for one reason or another.</p>
<p>FYI - Beware Resharper 4.0 EAP's though, they have a tendency to&nbsp;get confused by 2.0 Projects with Extension methods, turning your&nbsp;Linq statements in a nested set of Enumerable.Where(... etc.&nbsp;calls.</p>
<p>Keith mentioned Pourable computing - which is not something I'd&nbsp;come across before (you can find it briefly discussed in this&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/90">TED&nbsp;talk</a> by <a href="http://ng.cba.mit.edu/">Neil Gershenfeld</a> -&nbsp;part of the <a href="http://cba.mit.edu/">CBA</a> @ MIT)</p>
<p>We also talked about <a href="http://www.mesh.com/">LiveMesh</a> -&nbsp;including the flaw in Vista (pre SP1) which prevented you from&nbsp;installing the LiveMesh software without UAC enabled... and Peter&nbsp;raised the question "why aren't you using UAC" ... annoying&nbsp;messages was the response - at which point he suggested we just&nbsp;disable them in the registry by setting<br>
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionPoliciesSystem onsentPromptBehaviorAdmin&nbsp;<span>to 0.</span></p>
<p>And then a recurring topic around source control, file versioning&nbsp;(i.e. never overwriting a file) and how office-wide mesh computing&nbsp;could help.</p>
<p>Thanks all for coming - see you all on the 15<sup>th</sup> of&nbsp;May.</p>
