  content: "Yeah, the blog needs a face-lift ... I've noticed the captcha thing myself
    - though I can't quite seem to figure out what's causing it... \n\nHopefully it'll
    be resolved when I migrate to subtext, when I find the time.\n\nCheers,\n\n -

<p>Just a quick note that I've put together a small guide on working&nbsp;with the Castle / Nhibernate / RhinoTools trunk <a href="http://wiki.bittercoder.com/CastleStackFromTrunk.ashx">here</a> on&nbsp;my <a href="http://wiki.bittercoder.com/">wiki</a>, which goes well&nbsp;as a companion to this article on <a href="http://using.castleproject.org/display/CASTLE/Using+the+Trunk">working&nbsp;with the Castle trunk</a> which can be found on <a href="http://using.castleproject.org">using.castleproject.org</a>.</p>
<p>Hopefully it proves useful to someone other that myself.</p>
