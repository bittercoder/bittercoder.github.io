<p>Someone recently sent me an email letting me know my NUnit&nbsp;"support" for IronPython project only targeted NUnit 2.2 and was a&nbsp;little out of date.</p>
<p>(For those not sure what I'm talking about - perhaps take a look&nbsp;back at these posts (<a href="http://blog.bittercoder.com/PermaLink,guid,6a49a44c-e3bc-44af-89ad-e2b8bb5ba67a.aspx">1</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.bittercoder.com/PermaLink,guid,86b0df08-9bb5-4d3b-a365-fdc7b5d57942.aspx">2</a>) from October of 2006)</p>
<p>I didn't realise anyone was actually using it - but I see it's&nbsp;being linked too from the <a href="http://www.ironpython.info/index.php/Contents#Misc">IronPython&nbsp;cookbook</a>, so I decided to take half an hour and update it to&nbsp;target NUnit 2.4 - I left it targeting IronPython 1.1 however&nbsp;instead of 2.0 (IronPython users should be able to handle that task&nbsp;if required).</p>
<p>The usage changes a little from NUnit 2.2 to 2.4, instead of&nbsp;deriving your tests from a custom TestSuite class you now just&nbsp;annotate an empty class with some attributes... makes everything a&nbsp;little cleaner as your project doesn't need to reference IronPython&nbsp;etc. any more.</p>
<pre>[PythonSuite, Script(FileName = "MyPythonFixture.py")] public class MyPythonSuite { }</pre><br />
The python files are embedded resources by default (though it's a&nbsp;minor code change to support external python files as well) - you&nbsp;can include multiple Script attributes for a single suite as well,&nbsp;if required.</p>
<p>If you want to dynamically include python resource files based on&nbsp;their content i.e. all embedded resources with a first line&nbsp;containing "#test" then you would do this:</p>
<pre>[PythonSuite(DiscoverEmbeddedResources = true, DiscoveryKey = "#test")] public class DynamicPythonSuite { }</pre><br />
The project is now split into two assemblies.</p>
<ul>
<li>IronPythonTest.Addin</li>
<li>IronPythonTest.Framework</li><br />
</ul><br />
The Addin assembly needs to be installed into your NUnit 2.4&nbsp;add-ins directory i.e. C:Program Files (x86)TestDriven.NET&nbsp;2.0NUnit2.4addins - you will need to place the IronPython&nbsp;assemblies in there as well if they're not registered in the<br />
GAC.</p>
<p>Only the framework assembly needs to be referenced in your project&nbsp;so you can have access to the PythonSuite and Script&nbsp;attributes.</p>
<p>And that's about it, all other questions should be answered in the&nbsp;posts from 2006, or just leave a comment on this post if you have&nbsp;any trouble.</p>
<p>Code can be downloaded from <a href="http://blog.bittercoder.com/content/binary/NunitAddinForIronPython24.zip">here</a>.</p>
