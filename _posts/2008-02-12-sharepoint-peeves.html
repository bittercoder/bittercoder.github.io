<p>I have to say SharePoint just continues to underwhelm me (as a&nbsp;developer, I don't mind the product itself I should probably make&nbsp;that clear)...</p>
<p>A couple of quick examples:</p>
<h3>Configuration over Convention<&#47;h3><br />
Regional settings and dates are a prime example - for instance&nbsp;you get a <SharePoint:DateTimeControl &#47;> which brings with it&nbsp;a common look and feel for date pickers in SharePoint... and on the&nbsp;various pre-canned forms etc. everything appears to display with&nbsp;the current user&#47;sites regional settings.</p>
<p>However whenever you use this control you end up resorting to code&nbsp;along the lines of:</p>
<pre>SPRegionalSettings regionalSettings = SPContext.Current.Web.CurrentUser.RegionalSettings ?? SPContext.Current.Web.RegionalSettings; myDatePickerControl.LocaleId = (int)regionalSettings.LocaleId;<&#47;pre><br />
Or extending your control yourself to do the same... why on earth&nbsp;would I not want the control to default to the current regional&nbsp;settings?</p>
<p>Again the lack of convention rears it's ugly head when working with&nbsp;SharePoint's SPGridView - if it's going to a render a date, why&nbsp;doesn't it render it with the current user's Locale in mind (which&nbsp;I've talked about in this &nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;wiki.bittercoder.com&#47;DatesNotWorkingWithDSTInSPGridView.ashx">hack<&#47;a> last year) - shouldn't these controls be taking that&nbsp;burden of responsibility away from me?</p>
<h3>Useless Extensions Points<&#47;h3><br />
When something is extensible in SharePoint, then&nbsp;generally:</p>
<ol>
<li>It's not documented (except by the community)<&#47;li>
<li>It doesn't really work for the most common scenario.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ol><br />
Take the &nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;msdn2.microsoft.com&#47;en-us&#47;library&#47;microsoft.sharepoint.webcontrols.spgridview.aspx">SPGridView<&#47;a> and &nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;msdn2.microsoft.com&#47;en-us&#47;library&#47;microsoft.sharepoint.webcontrols.spdatasource.aspx">SPDataSource<&#47;a> combo - with this you can setup a grid to feed<br />
from a CAML query pretty easily ... and it's smart enough to add&nbsp;the required <OrderBy&#47;> to the underlying CAML query when you&nbsp;sort on a column... so far so good.</p>
<p>But what if you want to sort on more then one column?</p>
<p>Well, you could try specifying more then one column in the grid's&nbsp;SortExpression - but this causes the SPDataSource to spit the&nbsp;dummy... so obviously the first question is why doesn't that work,&nbsp;when it works for other data sources, and would have been trivial<br />
to implement.</p>
<p>But not all hope is lost after opening reflector and perusing the&nbsp;code (which thankfully wasn't obfuscated in this case, though quite&nbsp;a bit of it is) you see that in fact you can specify additional&nbsp;sort columns in the original query and the SPDataSource is smart&nbsp;enough to keep them and insert the new field references into the&nbsp;existing <OrderBy&#47;>... a handy way for extending your query&nbsp;to have a number of default sort columns.</p>
<p>But there's a catch, it sticks the entries in the wrong position,&nbsp;so it will sort by the fixed columns first - rather then last -&nbsp;making it all but useless in most cases (users expect to click on a&nbsp;column and see the results sorted by the selected column first) ..&nbsp;And to be honest this still wouldn't worry me if I was given at&nbsp;least one virtual method to override allowing me to mutate the CAML&nbsp;query appropriately.</p>
