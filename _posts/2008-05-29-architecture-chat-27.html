    Your right, not quite the same as pile (though really a single "pile" like column in a relational database wouldn't make much sense, we were just floating some ideas).

    Sybase's IQ is looks quite interesting though, you can achieve some advantageous query plans with a column-oriented database, removing the need for tedious row-scans (and obviously avoiding needless duplication of data) - of course it would probably increase the cost of basic CRUD operations if you had a lot of columns.

<li>Thoughts around having <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.pilesys.com&#47;new&#47;news.php">pile<&#47;a>-like columns in a<br />
  database, and avoiding column-level information redundancy<br />
  (compressed column).<br &#47;><br />
  <&#47;li></p>
