    Your right, not quite the same as pile (though really a single "pile" like column in a relational database wouldn't make much sense, we were just floating some ideas).

    Sybase's IQ is looks quite interesting though, you can achieve some advantageous query plans with a column-oriented database, removing the need for tedious row-scans (and obviously avoiding needless duplication of data) - of course it would probably increase the cost of basic CRUD operations if you had a lot of columns.

  (compressed column).<br /><br />
  </li></p>
<li>StringBuilder performance.<br />
  </li></p>
<li>Practical uses for BigTable (and Amazon SimpleDB etc.).<br /><br />
