<p>Just a quick Architecture Chat update - due to a family&nbsp;bereavement that occurred this week I'm postponing the&nbsp;Architecture Chat till next Thursday (26th February).</p>
<p>I'll post the write-up for the last chat soon, as well as a&nbsp;follow up post of possible topics for the next chat - sorry for&nbsp;any inconvenience this might have caused, hope to see you all&nbsp;next week!</p>
