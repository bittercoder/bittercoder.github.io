    Sure thing - I'd be happy to enter into a discussion on functional programming and how it relates/influenced features in C# 3.0 (and also of course, where C#'s type system falls down when implementing some functional programming concepts).

    Incidentally have you ever had a look at parser combinators using C# 3.0 (http://blogs.msdn.com/lukeh/archive/2007/08/19/monadic-parser-combinators-using-c-3-0.aspx) I love that kind of code - lots of fun :)

<p>Architecture Chat Tomorrow... Some possible things to talk<br>
about:<br><br>
<br><br>
Subversion 1.5 - and it's new <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/svn_1.5_releasenotes.html#merge-tracking"><br>
merge tracking</a> features.<br><br>
<br><br>
<a href="http://hyperthink.net/blog/we-are-pleased-to-bring-you-new-features-in-net-3-5-sp1/"><br>
WCF/WF Features</a> in .Net Framework 3.5 SP1 - a blog post caught<br>
my eye with things I hadn't noticed before mostly around<br>
DataContract Serialization i.e. ability to serialize graphs (not<br>
just trees), an attribute-free mode for the serializer and a suite<br>
of strongly typed classes to make implementing AtomPub easier (i.e.<br>
Workspaces etc.).<br><br>
<br><br>
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/bclteam/archive/2008/06/23/p-invoke-interop-assistant-justin-van-patten.aspx"><br>
P/Invoke Interop Assistant</a> - handy little tool, about 5 years<br>
too late for me :)<br><br>
<br><br>
<a href="http://www.codeplex.com/umbrella">Umbrella Project</a> -<br>
Interesting project, take a look at Ayendes <a href="http://ayende.com/Blog/archive/2008/06/04/Review-Umbrella-project.aspx"><br>
involved post</a> for an overview.&nbsp; The<br>
ExtensionPoint<t> approach for making extensions more<br>
discoverable is interesting - something we discussed right back<br>
when the first beta's of VS2008 were on the horizon.<br><br>
<br><br>
I'd personally also like to talk about some thoughts people have on<br>
the bare minimums for a usable language and domain specific<br>
languages in particular - i.e. debugging, native support for<br>
comments etc. and some experiences with a rather hostile Model<br>
driven architecture transformation language I've had to deal with<br>
over the last couple of weeks :)<br><br>
<br><br>
As usual, if anyone has any topics - feel free to leave a comment,<br>
send me an email etc.<br><br>
<br><br>
Notes from previous meetings and directions etc. can be found<br>
<a href="http://wiki.bittercoder.com/SylviaParkArchitectureChats.ashx">here</a><br>
on my wiki - anybody is welcome to come along.<br><br>
<br></t></p>
