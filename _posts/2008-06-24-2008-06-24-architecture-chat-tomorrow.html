    Sure thing - I'd be happy to enter into a discussion on functional programming and how it relates&#47;influenced features in C# 3.0 (and also of course, where C#'s type system falls down when implementing some functional programming concepts).

    Incidentally have you ever had a look at parser combinators using C# 3.0 (http:&#47;&#47;blogs.msdn.com&#47;lukeh&#47;archive&#47;2007&#47;08&#47;19&#47;monadic-parser-combinators-using-c-3-0.aspx) I love that kind of code - lots of fun :)

<p>Architecture Chat Tomorrow... Some possible things to talk<br />
about:<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
Subversion 1.5 - and it's new <a href="http:&#47;&#47;subversion.tigris.org&#47;svn_1.5_releasenotes.html#merge-tracking"><br />
merge tracking<&#47;a> features.<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
<a href="http:&#47;&#47;hyperthink.net&#47;blog&#47;we-are-pleased-to-bring-you-new-features-in-net-3-5-sp1&#47;"><br />
WCF&#47;WF Features<&#47;a> in .Net Framework 3.5 SP1 - a blog post caught<br />
my eye with things I hadn't noticed before mostly around<br />
DataContract Serialization i.e. ability to serialize graphs (not<br />
just trees), an attribute-free mode for the serializer and a suite<br />
of strongly typed classes to make implementing AtomPub easier (i.e.<br />
Workspaces etc.).<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
<a href="http:&#47;&#47;blogs.msdn.com&#47;bclteam&#47;archive&#47;2008&#47;06&#47;23&#47;p-invoke-interop-assistant-justin-van-patten.aspx"><br />
P&#47;Invoke Interop Assistant<&#47;a> - handy little tool, about 5 years<br />
too late for me :)<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.codeplex.com&#47;umbrella">Umbrella Project<&#47;a> -<br />
Interesting project, take a look at Ayendes <a href="http:&#47;&#47;ayende.com&#47;Blog&#47;archive&#47;2008&#47;06&#47;04&#47;Review-Umbrella-project.aspx"><br />
involved post<&#47;a> for an overview.&nbsp; The<br />
ExtensionPoint<T> approach for making extensions more<br />
discoverable is interesting - something we discussed right back<br />
when the first beta's of VS2008 were on the horizon.<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
I'd personally also like to talk about some thoughts people have on<br />
the bare minimums for a usable language and domain specific<br />
languages in particular - i.e. debugging, native support for<br />
comments etc. and some experiences with a rather hostile Model<br />
driven architecture transformation language I've had to deal with<br />
over the last couple of weeks :)<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
As usual, if anyone has any topics - feel free to leave a comment,<br />
send me an email etc.<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
Notes from previous meetings and directions etc. can be found<br />
<a href="http:&#47;&#47;wiki.bittercoder.com&#47;SylviaParkArchitectureChats.ashx">here<&#47;a><br />
on my wiki - anybody is welcome to come along.<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;></p>
