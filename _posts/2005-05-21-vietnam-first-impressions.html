    Aiee... the weather is good, but bad... I think it's about 40 degrees at the moment in yonder vietnam - I'm dying.

    Mighty Shodan... perhaps one day she will become a "real" cat, like pinochio.

Hi all, well my border crossing at Moc Bai was easy.. if not long winded (took about an hour and a half just to get stamped out in Cambodia and back in at Vietnam) - so I didn't end up in Saigon/Ho Chi Minh City till about 4 in the afternoon (left Phnom Penh at about 7:30am).<br>

  <strong>First Impressions</strong><br>
</p>
<p>
First impressions of Vietnam are... well, great!&nbsp; I wasn't really knowing what to expect.. but&nbsp;so far it seems like a fusion of everything I've seen in asia so far, but with a personality all of it's own.<br>
</p>
<p>
There's a strong chinese influence, a bit of the pushy cambodian spirit for tourism and definitely a fading french colonial (like Laos)&nbsp;look to alot of the buildings - and so far the people themselves are lovely, the foods not too pricey and the digs are nice - I've set myself up in a swish $8/night room which has air-con, TV with cable, fridge, warm shower.. nice bed.. all the mod cons - I even indulged in watching TV in bed this morning (they had a 2 hour animated "star wars - the clone wars" on, it was tolerable... probably because I've had TV in so long).<br>
</p>
<p>
Poverty seems less "in your face" here then anywhere else I've been except maybe Thailand, the streets are all very clean and though many still wear traditional clothes,&nbsp;carry baskets on their heads and ride&nbsp;bicycles&nbsp;there is a definite abundance of technology in any peoples hands - obviously this is a bustling city, with me in the heart of it (well the stomach probably) - so my first impressions are really of HCMC as opposed to Vietnam, but I feel strangely at home here - maybe it's just because it reminds me a little of China (Which has been my favourite country so far) - but I really don't feel any culture shock - I definitely think I'll enjoy my last 3 or so weeks of travel here, and my stomach is back on form so that will hopefully include loads of local cuisine :)<br>
</p>

  <strong>Rain and art museums</strong><br>
</p>
<p>
Well today I decided to go and check out the art museum... it was pretty cool - an interesting mix of war related art, with uncle Ho featuring in many aspects (I love his goatee)... ancient artifacts from&nbsp;the last&nbsp;1800 years and&nbsp;some pretty cool pieces of porcelain, bronze work.. oh and&nbsp;some modern'ish artwork,&nbsp;of umm... varying qualities, but it was insightful to see how various techiques and styles have been adopted and changed/chanelled into truely vietnamese works.</p>
<p>
The museum is set in a old french colonial building with stained glass windows, dusty tiled floors and poor lighting... but it's truely gorgeous it's own quaint way -&nbsp;I probably&nbsp;spent as much time looking at the bulding itself as the exhibits... which was enhanced by the amazing electrical storm taking place outside - mucho goodness - then again I'm always happy when it rains.<br>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Fruit vendors</strong><br>
</p>
<p>
Oh.. and early this morning I bought some fruit (granny smith apples from NZ, and oranges from California.. apparently) -&nbsp;I'm not sure quite how, but the lady at the market somehow managed to sell me almost entirely bad fruit... but I would've sworn as I watched her pick them that they looked great, I'd even inspected them earlier.. which leads me to believe I was actually attacked by some harpy who hexed me into buying her foul and fetid produce... I'll have to be on my guard next time - maybe I should've taken a 20?<br>
</p>
<p>
  Oh and tomorrow I start my tour of Vietnam with intrepid, so that should be interesting - hopefully the group is as&nbsp;good&nbsp;as It was in China.</p>
