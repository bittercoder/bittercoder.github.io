<h1>Abstractions...&nbsp; mmmm... so sweet</h1><br />
...a post from <a href="http://www.ayende.com/Blog/AbstractingAbstractnessIntoAbstractAbstractnessOfAbstractedAbstratness.aspx">Ayende on abstractions</a>, and specifically a mention of the&nbsp;logging "abstraction" in Castle... it's an interesting thing, for&nbsp;the Seismic product I worked logging (via the same abstraction)&nbsp;into a product a year or more ago...&nbsp; in the end we needed the&nbsp;ability to log contextual information (basically exposing features&nbsp;already existing in <strong>log4net</strong> at the time, but not available&nbsp;via the Castle <strong>ILogger</strong> interface) and so I ended up creating&nbsp;a new interface that was a superset of the existing abstraction,&nbsp;<strong>IExtendedLogger</strong>...</p>
<p>here's the devil... looks simple...</p>
<pre>public interface IExtendedLogger : ILogger { void AddProperty(string key, object value); void RemoveProperty(string key); }</pre><br />
However... because we're being a good little abstraction&nbsp;"<em>whore</em>" we end up with a few more classes to support&nbsp;this new interface, and make the user experience more&nbsp;pleasurable:</p>
<p><img src="http://blog.bittercoder.com/content/binary/logging_extractions.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Though I was reasonably pleased with the end result a year ago,&nbsp;that was probably a couple of hours work + some more time&nbsp;tweaking (once you include the time to code up that test&nbsp;fixtures) that would've been better spent building additional&nbsp;functionality into the product.</p>
<p>I have to admit the lure of a needless abstraction is ever&nbsp;present to me... I enjoy halving a class into an abstract and&nbsp;concrete implementation, and then extracting an interface is like&nbsp;the candy coating... prefixing the concrete implementation with&nbsp;"Default" makes it even seem like you've all but got people&nbsp;lining up to create their own versions!&nbsp; Wow, isn't it&nbsp;powerful, flexible.. and all sorts of other words ending in "ul"&nbsp;or "ile".</p>
<p>....But in the end, needless is needless - and I haven't needed&nbsp;the flexibility gained from this abstraction so far... after a&nbsp;year... a whole year, that's pretty much like never... sure I had&nbsp;grand plans, but they never did come to fruition... and grand&nbsp;plans don't keep me fed - <a href="http://c2.com/xp/YouArentGonnaNeedIt.html">YAGNI</a> strikes&nbsp;again.</p>
<p>About the only thing I find the needless abstractions do is in&nbsp;clarifying my thinking on what I do and don't need, or more&nbsp;importantly what I do and don't want people to do with my&nbsp;code.... it let's me define just what I want my "<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/brada/archive/2003/10/02/50420.aspx">pit&nbsp;of success</a>" behavior to be, albeit not the implementation...&nbsp;Perhaps some of this stuff is better reserved for throw away&nbsp;prototypes then production code.</p>
<p>I think the best book I've found for discouraging this "<em>80's&nbsp;guitar solo</em>" of abstraction..um...ism is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Framework-Design-Guidelines-Conventions-Development/dp/0321246756">Framework Design Guidelines</a>... Though these abstractions do&nbsp;make it easy for me to maintain and grow my code (and the&nbsp;orthogonality of the design is generally good) it comes at the&nbsp;price of other people having difficulty learning my API through&nbsp;experimentation, and I fail to create a progressive framework...&nbsp;which after reading the aforementioned book, is something we all&nbsp;wan't to do.</p>
<p>I guess the final question is, do you reverse an abstraction that&nbsp;isn't required after such a long time...?&nbsp; Or do you just&nbsp;avoid making the same mistake twice and live with the&nbsp;abstraction, assuming it's not hurting too many people - Is it&nbsp;worth lumping it with the rest of the "<em>broken windows</em>"&nbsp;in a project, or is that a little too brash?</p>
