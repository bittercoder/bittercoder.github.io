    I've never actually felt an earthquake before, but then I've never spent more then a couple of days in wellington at a time :) ... still you probably wouldn't notice it as your getting blown sideways right ? :P

    What I did find funny was that Renee (my Fiancee) said the last time the house shook like that was because somebody had torched a car just round the corner and it had consequently exploded - I'll be moving to a new neighborhood before a new continent! ;o)

<p>The whole house reverberated last night... not too impressive, but&nbsp;strangely odd... I figured &nbsp;iit was probably an earth quake, but&nbsp;thats none too common in Auckland, so I also figured it might've&nbsp;just been a a really large truck, or perhaps a car exploding<br />
;o)</p>
<p>... but turned out it <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/3970550a10.html">was</a> an earth&nbsp;quake...</p>
<p>Which got me to thinking, I haven't got any survival instincts when&nbsp;it comes to earth quakes ... I'd probably just stand around going&nbsp;"wow, never seen this before" as the roof collapsed on top of me, I&nbsp;probably wouldn't even think to save my laptop :P</p>
<p>Lets hope a bigger one isn't to follow!</p>
