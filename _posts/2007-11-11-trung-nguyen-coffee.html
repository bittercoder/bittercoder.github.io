So I rediscovered my&nbsp;Vietnamese coffee dripper today... and a small cache of <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.trung-nguyen-online.com&#47;">Trung Nguy?n<&#47;a> coffee I had&nbsp;secreted away after getting back from my Asian excursion a while&nbsp;ago... a little dubious as to whether it would have stood the test&nbsp;of time I brewed a test batch...</p>
<p>And had completely forgotten just how strong it is... yikes - I've&nbsp;been on caffeine buzz for the last hour or so ... it has such a&nbsp;distinctive flavor too... took me straight back to sitting in 35&nbsp;degree heat, drinking extremely strong coffee mixed with ice cubes&nbsp;and condensed milk in the Vietnamese jungle... (it was a lot more&nbsp;fun then it sounds, though the sweetened condensed milk is a bit&nbsp;too sweet for my liking)</p>
<p>So at any rate - I'm starting to unwind after an incredibly busy&nbsp;period of work - think 16+ hour days for a couple of months ...&nbsp;which has left me a little shattered to say the least... so I'm&nbsp;unwinding a little today...&nbsp; The lawns are mowed, the sun is<br />
shining and I've started to read &nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;Beautiful-Code-Leading-Programmers-Practice&#47;dp&#47;0596510047">Beautiful Code<&#47;a> - which I've heard mixed reviews of, but I<br />
figure it'd be a nice change from SharePoint blogs and should&nbsp;hopefully put me in the right frame of mind as a shift my focus&nbsp;back to projects revolving around ALT.Net technologies once&nbsp;again.</p>
