    Woops - Try it now... seems to be working for me.

<p>So the first 9 posts are up for the container tutorial&nbsp;series...&nbsp; but I haven't made much mention of what can be done&nbsp;to play around with the windsor container yourself while reading&nbsp;this series.</p>
<p>Well first-off ... my thoughts on getting started with the Castle&nbsp;project are generally practical, first off I think it's worth&nbsp;grabbing the <a href="http://www.castleproject.org/castle/download.html">second release&nbsp;candidate</a> - check out what castle can do, have a general play,&nbsp;maybe try to generate a monorail project and get it working... and&nbsp;then ... well I would probably <span>uninstall</span> it, and grab the&nbsp;latest cut of the castle project and contributed projects from svn&nbsp;and build it yourself using nant.</p>
<p>This gives you opportunities to use all the "new stuff" that gets&nbsp;added day by day (as well as bug fixes) but also ensures your&nbsp;actually capable of building and contributing patches for any&nbsp;issues you discover.</p>
<p>But that's a bit of an ask for someone experimenting, especially if&nbsp;you don't know anything about svn... so essentially for playing&nbsp;around with the basics of the windsor container, you only need 4&nbsp;Castle assemblies from the bleeding edge, and I'll give them to&nbsp;you:</p>
<p><img src="http://blog.bittercoder.com/content/binary/simple_container_references.png" alt=""></p>
<p>And to make life easy I included those assemblies in a folder&nbsp;called "SharedLibs" as part of the following zip file, which&nbsp;contains the code for the first 9 parts... I'll do another code<br>
drop at the end of the container tutorials to round out the series&nbsp;for the sake of posterity... but everything you need for the first&nbsp;9 tutorials is here:<br>
