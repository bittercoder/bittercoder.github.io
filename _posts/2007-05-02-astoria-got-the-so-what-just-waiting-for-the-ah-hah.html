<p>So looking at <a href="http:&#47;&#47;astoria.mslivelabs.com&#47;">Astoria<&#47;a><br />
very briefly today ... a good starting point is probably <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.base4.net&#47;">Alex James<&#47;a> blog and all the linked<br />
posts - and so far I'm left with a "so what" attitude to the<br />
technology releases so far (but it is very early days).<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
I feel like what's being presented is something I could cobble<br />
together using <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.opengarden.org&#47;dream">Dream<&#47;a><br />
and <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.castleproject.org&#47;activerecord&#47;index.html">ActiveRecord<&#47;a>&#47;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.nhibernate.org&#47;">NHibernate<&#47;a><br />
or <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.base4.net&#47;">Base4<&#47;a> with a couple of weeks<br />
work at best... I'm probably being a little optimistic though ;o)<br />
Devil is always in the detail... but what's in the wild so far<br />
hasn't made me sit up and take notice, I hope the next couple of<br />
drops will though.<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
However in the mean time, what does interest me:<br &#47;></p>
<ul>
<li>Standardization of a query scheme... so far I've only seen<br />
  examples of search&#47;get queries.. I'm particularly interested in<br />
  any update related queries... this is where the opportunities for<br />
  doing evil live, and where community input will be vital I think.<br />
  <&#47;li></p>
<li>How does WebDAV fit into the Astoria picture at the<br />
  moment?<br &#47;><br />
  <&#47;li></p>
<li>Astoria SaaS ... I find the idea of being able to design and<br />
  provision REST'ful stores on the web (with my own schema) quite<br />
  intriguing.<br />
  <&#47;li></p>
<li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
<ul>
<li>That said - I'm not sure what I'd do with it, but I still<br />
      want it ;o)<br />
      <&#47;li><br />
    <&#47;ul></p>
<ul>
<li>And thinking out loud, but besides the obvious uses for<br />
      web&#47;ajax&#47;flash&#47;silverlight fraternity *yawn* - could this<br />
      kind of thing actually give new life to some desktop based<br />
      applications - It could certainly smarten them up a bit, so<br />
      that using the same application on multiple machines (i.e.<br />
      work&#47;home) could optionally give you the same<br />
      experience.<br &#47;><br />
      <&#47;li><br />
    <&#47;ul><br />
  <&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul></p>
