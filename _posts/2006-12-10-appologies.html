<p>Apologies for the extended blog down-time... moved house last weekend (and did a few major changes to my network, including a entirely new domain etc.) and only just got a chance to set up an&nbsp;Ubuntu/apache/mod_proxy box for forwarding requests onto the&nbsp;server where my blog lives.</p>
<p>Drop me a comment if anything seems a little wonky (ie. missing&nbsp;images etc.) as I did the config in a hurry&nbsp; :)</p>
