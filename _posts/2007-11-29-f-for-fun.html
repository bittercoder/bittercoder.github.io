<p>So I'm learning F# in my spare time... I don't have much of that&nbsp;however.. so I kinda squeeze it in where I can, so I'm not&nbsp;progressing as fast I would like... None the less it's quite an&nbsp;easy language to get up to speed with, even as I stab at it blindly&nbsp;for half an hour a week... but some fundamentals can really trip&nbsp;you up when you're starting to learn and experiment without having&nbsp;developed a good mental model of whats going on... being a wannabe&nbsp;"expert" in the .Net framework and BCL doesn't necessarily give you&nbsp;much of edge when your moving from an imperative to functional&nbsp;programming language.</p>
<p>To that end this post is going to cover some really trivial&nbsp;observations, so for anyone that actually knows F# it's probably&nbsp;going to be pretty boring... and you might as well read something&nbsp;else ;o)</p>
<p>Anyway.. so, first off lets take evaluation order.</p>
<p>In C# I might write some code like so...</p>
<pre>char[] characters = new char[] { 'A','B','C','D','E'} foreach (char c in characters) Console.WriteLine("character: " + c);<&#47;pre><br />
Now in F# I could write something similar...</p>
<pre>let characters = [| 'A'..'E' |] for c in characters do print_endline "character: " + c.ToString()<&#47;pre><br />
But it wont compile... because it's evaluated&#47;applied from left to&nbsp;right, so it equates to (print_endline "character:") + c.ToString()&nbsp;... which can't compile because print_endline returns a result of&nbsp;type 'unit' (think void... though it is actually a return value)...&nbsp;thankfully it's a compiled language so these things are picked up&nbsp;immediately - but it can make for silly&#47;confusing compilation&nbsp;errors when starting out.</p>
<p>Now, moving on from there.. past experience has also helped screw&nbsp;up my mental model... for example iteration related functions - if&nbsp;I was going to write an iteration function in C# the approach would&nbsp;generally be to do something like this:</p>
<pre>public void ForEach<T>(IEnumerable<T> items, Action<T> action) { foreach (T item in items) action(item); } string[] words = new string[] { "somewhere", "on", "earth", "little", "kids", "teach", "themselves", "a", "whistling", "sound", "to", "imitate", "bombs", "dropping" }; ForEach(words, delegate(string s) { Console.Write(s + " "); });<&#47;pre><br />
I had the expectation of finding replicas in the F# built-in&nbsp;functions like List.iter etc. - in fact I even wrote code like this&nbsp;to start with, assuming it would work in the same manor.</p>
<pre>List.iter words (fun word -> print_string (word + " "))<&#47;pre><br />
After that didn't compile I just swapped the parameters... it&nbsp;worked... but I saw some unusual behavior when stepping through it&nbsp;with the debugger... and it required further inspection... looking&nbsp;at the signature for List.iter revealed that it was actually a&nbsp;function that returned a function ...&nbsp; <strong>('a->unit) ->&nbsp;(list 'a -> unit)<&#47;strong>... hmmm..</p>
<p>So it turns out most of the built-in functions take a single&nbsp;function and return a function... so unlike the C# equivalent, the&nbsp;F# foreach would look something like the code below (though I&nbsp;suspect an F# guru might be able to write it in a more terse&nbsp;manor).</p>
<pre>let words = [ "somewhere"; "on"; "earth"; "little"; "kids"; "teach"; "themselves"; "a"; "whistling"; "sound"; "to"; "imitate"; "bombs"; "dropping" ] let foreach f = let rec foreachInList l = match l with | head :: tail -> f head foreachInList tail | _ -> () foreachInList let n = foreach (fun word -> print_string (word + " ")) n words &#47;&#47; or words |> foreach (fun word -> print_string (word + " ")) &#47;&#47; or foreach (fun word -> print_string (word + " ")) words<&#47;pre><br />
It took me a minute or so of going hmmmm to absorb the beauty of&nbsp;that approach... obviously this is bread and butter of a functional&nbsp;programmer, but for a non-functional programmer like myself you&nbsp;tend to just see twice as much "work" going on (two function calls&nbsp;for starters).</p>
<p>Take a look at the second way of calling foreach... in this case&nbsp;|> applies the RHS as a filter on the LHS... because the&nbsp;function takes a single parameter we can do this easily.. but we&nbsp;can also chain them together... so we could alter our foreach&nbsp;function a smidgen:</p>
<pre>let foreach f = let rec foreachOnList l = match l with | head :: tail -> f head head :: (foreachOnList tail) | _ -> [] foreachOnList<&#47;pre><br />
So it's signature is no longer <strong>('a->unit) -> (list 'a&nbsp;-> unit)<&#47;strong> but is instead <strong>('a->unit) -> ('a list&nbsp;-> 'a list)<&#47;strong> ... now I can chain calls to my foreach&nbsp;together...</p>
<pre>words |> foreach (fun word -> print_string (word + " ")) |> foreach (fun wor -> print_string (word.ToUpper() + "_"))<&#47;pre><br />
I really enjoy the elegance and simplicity of the filter syntax...&nbsp;if you replace the anonymous functions with functions you've&nbsp;already declared it suddenly becomes pretty, I think it reads nicer&nbsp;then chained extension method calls &#47; fluent interfaces in&nbsp;C#.</p>
<pre>let capitalize (c: string) = c.ToUpper() let pad c = c + " " words |> List.iter (fun word -> word |> capitalize |> pad |> print_string)<&#47;pre><br />
At any rate, my half hour of F# exploration is up for the&nbsp;week.</p>
