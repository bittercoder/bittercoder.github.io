<p>Have you ever wanted to be able to do something like this in<br>
C#?<br><br>
<br><br>
<b>string propertyName = GetName(MyClass.MyProperty);</b><br><br>
<br><br>
Well I have, in fact I've wanted the ability to do this since<br>
Version 1 of the .Net Framework, and now with C# 3.0 we finally<br>
can!<br><br>
<br><br>
First off, check out the original blog post here - <a href="http://themechanicalbride.blogspot.com/2007/03/symbols-on-steroids-in-c.html"><br>
Symbols in C# 3.0</a> by <a href="http://themechanicalbride.blogspot.com/">Jafar Husain</a> - it's a<br>
clever (and once I thought about, plainly obvious) use of extension<br>
methods and expression trees.<br><br>
<br></p>
<pre>
public static class SymbolExtensions<br>
{<br>
    public static string GetPropertySymbol<t,r>(this T obj, Expression<><t, r="">> expr)<br>
    {<br>
        return ((System.Linq.Expressions.MemberExpression)           (((System.Linq.Expressions.LambdaExpression)(expr)).Body)).Member.Name;<br>
    }<br>
}<br>
</t,></t,r></pre><br><br>
Usage requires a lambda, but that's not to painful, here's example<br>
usage:<br><br>
<br>
<pre>
MyClass o;<br>
//...<br>
string propertyName = this.GetPropertySymbol(o => o.MyProperty)<br>
</pre><br><br>
The beauty of this is that refactoring is entirely painless, you<br>
don't need to spend time reviewing all the optional string<br>
replacements that resharper may have found in case you haven't<br>
mirrored a property or method name change correctly... it also<br>
looks like it could offer some nice usability improvements to some<br>
unit testing scenarios (nothing worse then unit tests that don't<br>
seamlessly refactor with your code).<br><br>
<br><br>
I wonder what other ideas are floating around for expression trees<br>
at the moment (outside of the obvious querying concepts) ?<br>
