<h2>Architecture Chat</h2><br>
So we had a reasonable turnout today, with 9 people.
<p>First up for discussion was the move from Microsoft to <a href="http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2007/Sep-05.html">assist with the&nbsp;development of Moonlight</a> - which is making silver light an even&nbsp;more compelling proposition then it was before...</p>
<p>There was a brief talk about WPF component suites ... some of the&nbsp;more win forms focused of the group are looking for an easier&nbsp;migration path from Winforms to WPF lead by a full featured control&nbsp;suite...&nbsp; A few of us observed that Telerik are planning to&nbsp;release a WPF suite of controls later on this year, and of course&nbsp;they already have <a href="http://www.telerik.com/products/silverlight/overview.aspx">RadControls<br>
for Silverlight</a> available now.&nbsp; DevExpress are also&nbsp;planning to release WPF controls "some time" this year, though not&nbsp;much information is available on just what makes up a "control&nbsp;suite" for WPF, considering the power provided just through the&nbsp;great data binding experience, simple controls like lists and the&nbsp;native 3D support.</p>
<p>Following that we had a rather rambling conversation sparked off by&nbsp;Alex J buying an iMac for his mum, and my desire for an entirely&nbsp;modal windows experience for my grandmother - or at least something&nbsp;that stopped windows from being able to completely occlude each&nbsp;other (which can cause all sorts of confusion when people associate&nbsp;a window "disappearing" with an action having taken place, like an&nbsp;email being sent).</p>
<p>Peter mentioned a project (which I didn't quite catch the name of)&nbsp;which creates a "modal" almost terminal-like experience for&nbsp;windows, which sounds like it could be interesting... I'm thinking&nbsp;perhaps I need to write myself a entirely modal shell for windows... maybe a task for a full-screen WPF app ;o)</p>
<p>That lead on to a conversation about undo and document change&nbsp;tracking, concluding in a few thoughts - we covered a random&nbsp;assortment of topics including MOSS 2007, WebDav and the poor&nbsp;uptake/usage of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume_Shadow_Copy_Service">shadow&nbsp;copy</a> some of the "thoughts" included:</p>
<ul>
<li>New versions of documents shouldn't be able to overwrite old&nbsp;documents, period, bake in at the OS level.</li>
<li>There needs to be a change to the usability of undo/redo so&nbsp;that you can move backwards and forwards through change history&nbsp;using a slider or some kind of similar time line experience.</li>
<li>Previous text can be copied and then the slider dragged back&nbsp;to the "current state" to paste (With no way of interacting with&nbsp;the previous state, to avoid accidentally loosing the current&nbsp;state).</li><br>
</ul><br>
After that we branched out into talking about Load balancing,&nbsp;Amazon E2 i.e. the Elastic cloud, Peter hadn't heard about &nbsp;<a href="http://dev.mainsoft.com/Default.aspx?tabid=267#How%20does%20Grasshopper%20work?">Grasshopper</a> but seemed pretty excited by the thought of&nbsp;converting .Net applications to run on J2EE (and as such, commodity&nbsp;hardware) - though <a href="http://www.slyce.com/">Gareth</a>&nbsp;mentioned it wasn't all that cheap, so you probably need to avoid&nbsp;having to pay a few windows server licenses to balance to&nbsp;books.
<p><a href="http://www.base4.net/Blog.aspx?ID=569">Data Layer&nbsp;Componentization</a> and the concept of a DataServer also got a&nbsp;mention, a long with some discussion around the lack of an off the&nbsp;shelf product which solves some of the "tough" problems with&nbsp;implementing highly scalable and distributed data platforms ah la&nbsp;things like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BigTable">BigTable</a> and similar&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce">map-reduce</a>&nbsp;style data storage concepts.&nbsp; I wonder if <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/ralfw/archive/tags/Pile/default.aspx">Pile</a>&nbsp;can offer us anything in this space as well?</p>
<p>Last of all Alex J briefly asked about mixed-mode authentication&nbsp;for IIS - as it happens Ayende recently&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ayende.com/Blog/archive/2007/08/30/Mixed-Mode-Authentication.aspx">posted</a> about this, with the gritty details of getting it to&nbsp;work.</p>
<p>And I think that's about enough from me... also don't forgot we&nbsp;have 2 user groups next week (Tuesday in Ellerslie, Wednesday in&nbsp;Auckland Central), details are below.</p>
