<p>This is the write-up for last weeks Architecture Chat #40 - you&nbsp;may be wondering what happened to #39 from last year -&nbsp;unfortunately the paper I noted all the details down onto&nbsp;mysteriously disappeared during the run up to xmas, we covered a&nbsp;few interesting things in that last session - one conversation I&nbsp;do recall that was focused on monitoring windows services -&nbsp;dealing with falling over (including fail over), ways to engineer&nbsp;windows services so they are both robust and easy to&nbsp;debug&#47;diagnose, and the effect of using MSMQ over say a&nbsp;roll-your-own file or database solution for queued&nbsp;data&#47;messages.&nbsp; Hopefully at some point I'll track down the&nbsp;notes so I can post the entire write up with all the details.</p>
<p>In the mean time here is the write up for #40...</p>
<p>For our first meeting of the year we didn't talk about much that&nbsp;was on the list of topics, as everyone was just catching up on&nbsp;the general state of the industry - we also saw some old faces,&nbsp;including one who hadn't been to a chat for more then a year!</p>
<p>Here's what we talked about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fruit packing machines, and the differences between rapid&nbsp;prototyping of machines (i.e. multiple months) verse rapid&nbsp;prototyping of software (a couple of weeks or less).&nbsp; Also&nbsp;talked about the cost&#47;current state of rapid prototyping machines&nbsp;and devices that can build themselves.<&#47;li>
<li>Talked about the current financial state - if anyone is&nbsp;seeing a slowdown (the answer in short - yes) but most people&nbsp;were having a busy January, with little idea of what would happen&nbsp;six months from now.<&#47;li>
<li>Talked about the 1400 (though it's eventually going to be&nbsp;something like 5000, according to the press) Microsoft Staff&nbsp;lay-off's that happened last Thursday and&#47;or were about to take&nbsp;place the following day - and did some musing around what&nbsp;departments were being laid off, why, and if any of our NZ&nbsp;exports into Microsoft would be affected (The Entity Framework&nbsp;and SharePoint teams seemed fairly unscathed).<&#47;li>
<li>Talked briefly about increased intensity in recruiters cold&nbsp;calling - and the interesting phenomenon of them making explicit&nbsp;enquiries into how business is going, if you think it's going to&nbsp;get worse over the coming months etc.&nbsp; It seems like&nbsp;recruiters have less idea what's going on then developers in the&nbsp;NZ IT Industry.<&#47;li>
<li>Talked about the interesting observation that a number of&nbsp;BA's and PM's are rejoining the industry after diverging into&nbsp;other careers such as real estate - and the obvious warnings&nbsp;about checking their recent employment histories, as they are&nbsp;inevitably out of touch with the world of technology.<&#47;li>
<li>Briefly discussed thoughts on Probative programming, and the&nbsp;fact it seems more of a pipe dream then something that could be a&nbsp;reality... being force to write tests before code can compile&nbsp;seems a sure fire way to encourage the wrong kind of testing&nbsp;practices, and certainly would result in tests being written&nbsp;"just for the sake of coverage".<&#47;li>
<li>Discussed Lean - most of us agreed strongly with the ideas of&nbsp;reducing wastage, delaying to the last responsible moment to&nbsp;commit to specific design&#47;implementation etc..&nbsp; But we did&nbsp;wonder if identifying the last responsible moment is the kind of&nbsp;thing that's only identifiable once you've passed it without&nbsp;prior experience.&nbsp; I think as our understanding of lean&nbsp;grows and we start dabbling in implementing it ourselves a more&nbsp;well-informed follow-up conversation or two will follow.<&#47;li>
<li>Talked about form-letter document generation, and issues of&nbsp;current tools&#47;solutions - this also branched off into general&nbsp;word&#47;pdf&#47;rich document generation...some points around this were:
<ul>
<li>Current products are clunky or just too expensive&nbsp;(product opportunities exist for smart people).<&#47;li>
<li>Using the Word COM API vs. directly manipulating the XML&nbsp;in the DOCX package (which is of course just a zip file).<&#47;li>
<li>Use of 3rd part libraries for document generation (such&nbsp;as <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.aspose.com&#47;categories&#47;file-format-components&#47;aspose.words-for-.net-and-java&#47;default.aspx"> Aspose.Words<&#47;a>).<&#47;li>
<li>Replacing content in PDF's, different between text and&nbsp;binary PDF's.<&#47;li>
<li>The interesting note that for generating rich documents&nbsp;(like product catalogues) the automation API for PowerPoint&nbsp;is a lot easier to use then that of Word (for client apps).<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
The next chat will be on the <strong>5th of February<&#47;strong> -&nbsp;Which is the day before <strong>Waitangi<&#47;strong> day - so if&nbsp;anyone can't make it drop me an email and I'll look at&nbsp;rescheduling it to another day that suits everyone.</p>
