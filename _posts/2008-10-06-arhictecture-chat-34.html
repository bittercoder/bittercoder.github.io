<p>We talked about a couple of announcments, including the Prism V2&nbsp;Drop 1, and it's multi-targeting support for Silverlight/WPF&nbsp;(Something we've talked about for a while since WPF &amp; WPF/E&nbsp;first emerged) - we did cover some of the other announcments in<br />
this <a href="http://blog.bittercoder.com/PermaLink,guid,37d596b9-6aa0-4744-acba-fc6b402a4465.aspx">post</a> as well.</p>
<p>After that we ended up with quite a general discussion on what&nbsp;makes adopting unit testing (and test driven) practices difficult&nbsp;and how mocking/stubbing/AAA etc. fits in.&nbsp; Interesting&nbsp;side-topics included the idea of teaching test driven development&nbsp;as the very first part of a first-year programming paper at&nbsp;university, behaviour driven development / specs etc.</p>
<p>We had another new comer this week - Guy - who gave us some&nbsp;perspective on how shops still focusing on C/C++ work - as always&nbsp;it's great to have newcomers coming along and contributing to the&nbsp;conversation.</p>
<p>Guy was Albany based, which raised the question again of if we need&nbsp;to have the odd Architecture chat over on the shore - my only&nbsp;concern is that we'd probably loose half of our existing attendees,&nbsp;so unless I got interest for a good 4 or 5 people on the shore It's<br />
probably not worth bothering with - and we'd need a location that's&nbsp;not too noisy (we abandoned our original location in Ellerslie for&nbsp;that very reason).</p>
<p>Apologies for the late post - I have been experiencing a lot of&nbsp;issues since &nbsp;<a href="http://blog.bittercoder.com/PermaLink,guid,73e94c4e-ef7a-4dc0-9031-00763cd7b36b.aspx">moving to Orcons LLU</a> (that'll teach me for hosting this blog&nbsp;and wiki on-site :)</p>
<p>Write-ups of previous Architecture Chats can be found on the&nbsp;<a href="http://wiki.bittercoder.com/SylviaParkArchitectureChats.ashx">wiki</a>&nbsp;here.</p>
