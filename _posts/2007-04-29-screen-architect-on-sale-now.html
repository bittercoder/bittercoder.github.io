<p><a href="http://www.devdefined.com/">DevDefined Ltd.</a> have been working with <a href="http://www.screenarchitect.com/">Screen Architect Ltd</a> and <a href="http://www.catch.net.nz/">Catch Limited</a> to produce a UI Prototyping add-in for <a href="http://www.sparxsystems.com.au/">Enterprise Architect (EA)</a> - and we are pleased to see that they made their first public release, with the product now on sale from their website.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
For anyone who uses Enterprise Architect, and already does UI modeling within EA, or UI prototyping with another application (or wishes to) - then why not take a look at the Screen Architect's flagship Add-in (there's a 30 day trial available).</p>
