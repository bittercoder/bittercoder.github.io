<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.devdefined.com&#47;">DevDefined Ltd.<&#47;a> have been working with <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.screenarchitect.com&#47;">Screen Architect Ltd<&#47;a> and <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.catch.net.nz&#47;">Catch Limited<&#47;a> to produce a UI Prototyping add-in for <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.sparxsystems.com.au&#47;">Enterprise Architect (EA)<&#47;a> - and we are pleased to see that they made their first public release, with the product now on sale from their website.<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
For anyone who uses Enterprise Architect, and already does UI modeling within EA, or UI prototyping with another application (or wishes to) - then why not take a look at the Screen Architect's flagship Add-in (there's a 30 day trial available).</p>
