  Hi Guys,<br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>
  Well I'm in Xi'an, at a "Redwoods Network" internet cafe - which<br />
  isn't far from the hotel, it's actually pretty good (not too<br />
  smokey, which is a miracle).<br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>
  Last night through to this morning I was travelling on the hard<br />
  sleeper train (basically groups of 6 bunks (3 high per side)<br />
  facing each other, and no real seats or doors.&nbsp; It's not a<br />
  bad way to travel, you generally just end up drinking a little..<br />
  playing some cards and doing bugger all else (once it's dark you<br />
  don't see alot, and the trips are generally always at night).<br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>
  However&nbsp;this'morning there was some fantastic sites as we<br />
  headed into the city, cooling towers, coal burners, chemical<br />
  plants... All with classic chinese-soviet chiq... ignoring the<br />
  rather "the worlds going to shit" aspect, it's truely imposing to<br />
  see the rolling expanse of never ending factories and power lines<br />
  scoring the landscape with the odd local farmers terraced plot in<br />
  between.<br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>
  Xi'an is a pretty amazing place, smoggy and thrumbing (like every<br />
  city we've visited) but with it's own character - it has the most<br />
  impressive city wall that I've seen in China, the thing is huge<br />
  and in good condition... we hired bikes and travelleed on top of<br />
  it today, about 14 kilometres (apparently) - it's amazing how<br />
  wide it is....<br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>
  Tonight me and a few of the other people in the group are going<br />
  to head out to the Muslim quarter to explore the markets (the<br />
  Muslim quarter is quite confined, with a number of big mosques<br />
  and ...somehow they squeeze 25,000 people into it).&nbsp; It<br />
  should be a good opportunity to find some spicy lamb and do some<br />
  haggling for crappy tat.<br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>
  Tomorrow we're off to see the Terracotta warriors and then that<br />
  evening we're on another train and heading off again...<br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>
  I'm feeling pretty good now, just a bit of a cough&#47;sore throat..<br />
  but otherwise not so bad, still haven't got my appetite back -<br />
  but then that's not necessarily a tragedy ;o)<br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>
  It's hard to believe that my trip through China is almost at an<br />
  end - other then a couple of days in Datong and Pingyao, we're<br />
  going to hit Beijing and that's pretty much it... A month is no<br />
  where near long enough!<br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>
  ...but at the same time I dont think I would want more at this<br />
  point - not without a break at least, China can be quite<br />
  challenging, especially if you're not used to smoggy frenetic<br />
  cities... it's well deserving of a culture shock rating :) as a<br />
  country goes.<br />
<&#47;p></p>
