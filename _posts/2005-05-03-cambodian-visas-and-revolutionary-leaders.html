<p>Well I got up early today to visit the Cambodian embassy... two&nbsp;photographs, $30 US and 6 hours later I have a pretty new 30 day&nbsp;visa for Cambodia - all the information I'd read&nbsp;on the&nbsp;internet was a little out of date, and it appears that the border&nbsp;I wish to cross at is officially open, and that&nbsp;Vientiane&nbsp;does offer an express visa service of 1 day when you spend $30&nbsp;US&nbsp;instead of $20...&nbsp;which is a relief, as I can now&nbsp;travel southwards once more towards my eventual border crossing&nbsp;into the land of killing fields and Angkor Wat.</p>
<p>After the Visa malarchy in the morning Charlotte and Myself got a&nbsp;tuk tuk to That Luang, basically a very large golden stupa - very&nbsp;picturesque&nbsp;- while here we also had a look at the&nbsp;horrendously&nbsp;prolific Laos artist who had his work on display, I&nbsp;think I counted at least 100 works... mostly oils and acrylics,but there was also some water colours and mixed media to spice&nbsp;things up...</p>
<p>After that we headed back into the&nbsp;central city, killed a&nbsp;bit of a time, then had lunch at Joma (I think that's what it's&nbsp;called) - basically a Zarbo's equivalent - I got lasagne and a<br>
tastey salad.&nbsp; Outside the restaurant was a lady with a&nbsp;cleft palate and a little baby girl&nbsp;of 7 months, who was&nbsp;very talkative, she even told me which direction I would have to<br>
walk if I needed to get to Bangkok... though it's a little far&nbsp;;o)</p>
<p>In the afternoon I explored the Laos National Museum.. this&nbsp;museum starts off with a small section on dinosaurs, then the&nbsp;plain of jars and similar ancient sites, very briefly covers<br>
minority races in Laos and then jumps into the main attraction on&nbsp;the second floor (which dominates most of the building) - that&nbsp;being the french occupation, declaration of independence and rise&nbsp;/ fall of communism (including the secret war obviously) in Laos<br>
- the english labels are patchy but you get a good feel, and the&nbsp;"artifacts" they've collected are great... it's not often you get&nbsp;to see a revolutionary leaders 1950's style spring "chest<br>
expander" - some of the pictures are fascinating, as you see&nbsp;Castro and Uncle Ho having a jolly old time with the Laos&nbsp;leaders.</p>
<p>The museum cements a view of the Laos as a progressive nation,&nbsp;with funny little displays of pharmaceuticals manufactured "right&nbsp;in Laos", as if the boxes of pills were required as proof that&nbsp;such a feat were possible.. and&nbsp;captions on pictures&nbsp;suggesting such wonderful things as "Disabled people are well&nbsp;cared for in Laos"...&nbsp;the "smell" of communist working class&nbsp;heroes and government saving face abounds, but I also could just&nbsp;be jaded&nbsp;- the people in Laos do generally seem to wish well&nbsp;of each other in general.</p>
<p>On the side.. at the guesthouse I'm staying (dragon lodge) a&nbsp;whole gaggle of IT students have arrived from Singapore, and are&nbsp;assisting the local hospital with improving their information&nbsp;systems and architecture over the next 2 weeks&nbsp;- which is&nbsp;interesting -&nbsp;I never really think that a skill set such as&nbsp;my own could be put to good work in an area like this... food for&nbsp;thought, and it does make me wonder why New Zealand IT&nbsp;institutions don't think of doing something like this... it would&nbsp;have to be great P.R, not to mention a lot of IT people would&nbsp;jump at the opportunity to combine study with a little travel.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I'll be jumping the bus to Savanaket - about 7 to 8&nbsp;hours, so that will pretty much take me out for the whole day...&nbsp;I haven't done a lot of research on the southern destinations of&nbsp;my journey through Laos, guess I'll do that in transit, it's nice<br>
to have a bit of a surprise anyway.</p>
