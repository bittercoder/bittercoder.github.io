<p>I've had a few inquiries from people re: when the next&nbsp;Architecture Chat is etc.</p>
<p>I'm currently on holiday in Europe, dodging Volcanic ash, Piles&nbsp;of rubbish in Amsterdam and flooding in Poland, where I'm&nbsp;currently at - though I'll be heading to the UK shortly, if&nbsp;anyone wants to catch up for a Beer... and won't be back in New&nbsp;Zealand until the second week of June.</p>

<p>(Flooding in Krakow)</p>
<p>In the mean time <a href="http://twitter.com/josh_robb">Josh Robb</a> and Peter B "may" be organising meetings - you can find more about what's going on by following <a href="https://wave.google.com/wave/ pli=1#restored:wave:googlewave.com!w%252BeuNiZbfvA.1">this wave</a>, or possibly checking the dot.net.nz mailing lists for announcements, though I think Josh is off to the UK shortly, so there may not be a meeting until I return... unless someone else wants to organise one in my absence.</p>
<p>See everyone in a few weeks time.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>- Alex</p>
