<p>I've been getting 2 or 3 emails every month from worried .Net&nbsp;Reactor users regarding the status of the product or looking for&nbsp;support ever since this &nbsp;<a href="http://blog.bittercoder.com/PermaLink,guid,73b24621-3a97-4df0-8a22-d08c82474499.aspx">post</a>... Truth is I'm not using the product at the moment, as I&nbsp;don't have any projects that need it right now - as such I'm not&nbsp;such a great point of contact!</p>
<p>At any rate, to try and deflect those queries to a more appropriate&nbsp;place (especially as I just don't have time to answer them in many&nbsp;cases) I've created the <a href="http://groups.google.co.nz/group/net-reactor-users">.Net Reactor&nbsp;users group</a> - a place for users of <a href="http://www.eziriz.com/">Eziriz</a> products to post questions,&nbsp;answers or to just ask if anyone is out there.</p>
<p>So if you do stumble across my blog, why not join the group and&nbsp;post your questions there rather then sending me an email (which I&nbsp;probably won't see or get the time to reply to).</p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong>: as an update, the google group is now being monitored&nbsp;by the .Net Reactor Author <strong>Denis Mierzwiak</strong> (MrBurns104) too,&nbsp;which is obviously a good thing.</p>
