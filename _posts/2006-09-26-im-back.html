<p>After a long hiatus from Blogging, I've returned... hopefully with a vengence, but more likely with a small "vurrrrp" sound... like hot air bubbling up through porridge.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Lets start off with a recap... Spectacles, testacles, wallet and all that jazz.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
My name is Alex Henderson, 26 years young, living in Auckland, New Zealand.&nbsp; I've been working on code since I was knee high, cut my teeth in GW Basic while in primary school, and C++ a few years after that... Now days I tend to spend my hours working in C# code, and my spare time in either .Net and ruby or python when I feel like a change.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
For the last year and a half I've been working for a start up company called <a title="Seismic Technologies" href="http://www.syzmk.com/">Seismic Technologies</a> which works in a rather ill-defined space, which I'll probably talk about in posts to come.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The main product I've been working on for Syzmk is the "<b>Rich Media Processor</b>" - it's a message clearing house, geared<br />
towards taking messages with rich content, transforming them, and then distributing them... The messages might be files on a network share, emails, SMS or MMS messages from a phone etc.&nbsp; It's all about rich content, so a large part of the product deals with transforming the content before furnishing it to line of business<br />
systems - we have been working with companies like <a titlesrc="XSOL New Zealand" href="http://www.xsol.com/">XSOL</a> who use our product to use messages from mobile devices to extend their business processes outside of the host organisation.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Before I was working for the Seismic, I was travelling around Asia for 4 months... which was a lot of fun, I hope to visit europe next... Then maybe Japan, Egypt and South America.<br /></p>
