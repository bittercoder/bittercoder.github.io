<p>It's been a long time since I've really felt "pleased" by the results of overclocking... probably back in the days of the 300A if truth be told, which is in the long long ago ;o) ... and for the last year I've been mostly using a laptop, and having really kept track of desktop tech.</p>
<p>... So I have to admit to being <strong>very</strong> pleasantly surprised when I built myself a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/90926978@N00/sets/72157600275471860/">Core Duo machine</a> (to be used while my Laptop is getting a labotomy) with a bottom of the barrel 4300 processor and then proceeded to overclock it from 1800mhz to 3042mhz ... that's a serious leap in performance :) very pleasing... and I still haven't hit the ceiling which is even more pleasing, I just had to stop fiddling and get on with doing some actual work.</p>
