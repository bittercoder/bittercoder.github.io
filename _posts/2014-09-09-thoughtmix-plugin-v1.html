<p>A little side-project of mine has involved building a new plugin for <a href="http://catchsoftware.com/testing-tools/enterprise-tester">Enterprise Tester</a>, the Test Management Software I've spent the last few years working on for Catch Software.</p>

<p>As of a couple of weeks ago I have finally released the plugin to the public.</p>

<p><a href="http://thoughtmix.com/"><img class="aligncenter size-full" title="Thoughtmix" src="http://thoughtmix.com/assets/img/logo1-default.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><a href="http://thoughtmix.com/">Thoughtmix.com - Powerpack Plugin for Enterprise Tester</a></strong></p>

<p>If you head on over to the website you can <a href="http://thoughtmix.com/Download">download the plugin installer</a>, and <a href="http://thoughtmix.com/Licenses/Trial">sign up for a free 30 day trial</a>. The plugin is compatible with Enterprise Tester version 4.10 and above.</p>

<p>As the name suggests, the "powerpack" is a grab-bag of new features for Enterprise Tester which allow customers to do more with their ET investment.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Custom Fields - Cascading Select, Geolocation, Labels, Sliders, Hidden Fields, Time Of Day, Users &amp; Groups etc.</li>
	<li>Dashboard Portlets - Including a grid search results portlet, tag cloud &amp; Who's online</li>
	<li>Run History Grid Column</li>
	<li>TQL Search functions for find results based on attachments or comments</li>
	<li>Community comments for the in-app help</li>
</ul>

<p>And based on community feedback we plan to add more features over time.</p>

<p>For any <a href="http://catchsoftware.com/testing-tools/enterprise-tester">Enterprise Tester</a> users out there - I would love it if you could give the plugin a try and provide any feedback you might have so we can continue to improve the product.</p>

<p>Also if you have any great ideas for other plugins you would like to see us build for ET, or features to add to the powerpack plugin, then head on over to our uservoice site <a href="http://thoughtmix.uservoice.com/">thoughtmix.uservoice.com</a> where you can post new ideas or vote for existing ones you would like to see implemented in upcoming releases of the product.</p>

<p>Happy Testing!</p>
