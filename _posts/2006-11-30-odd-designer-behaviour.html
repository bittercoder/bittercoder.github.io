<h2>
  The evil designer attribute ;o)<br />
<&#47;h2></p>
<p>
  I'm working on a project at the moment where the client want's an<br />
  "Add-in" for an existing piece of software... it's a COM interop<br />
  project, .Net 2.0 (and yes, it uses <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.castleproject.org&#47;">Castle<&#47;a>,&nbsp;IoC sits in<br />
  nicely with<br />
  the&nbsp;<strong>IServiceProvider<&#47;strong>&nbsp;:)&nbsp;and it<br />
  hosts a custom designer, and the add-ins must exist in their own<br />
  directory, outside of the host applications base directory.<br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>
  At any rate, it's been working just fine so far, but today I was<br />
  trying to introduce some custom designers... and they weren't<br />
  being constructed... which highlighted some odd behaviour in the<br />
  design time support - I have 6 or so&nbsp;assemblies,&nbsp;most<br />
  are support assemblies, some containing&nbsp;controls and their<br />
  associated designers, something like this:<br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>
  public class <strong>MyButtonDesigner<&#47;strong> :<br />
  <strong>ControlDesigner<&#47;strong> { ..}<br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>
  [<strong>Designer<&#47;strong>(typeof(<strong>MyButtonDesigner<&#47;strong>))]<br &#47;></p>
<p>  public class <strong>MyCustomButton<&#47;strong> :<br />
  <strong>ButtonBase<&#47;strong> { .. }<br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>
  And then there is the core assembly which hosts the design<br />
  surface etc. and contains a number of&nbsp; COM-visible classes<br />
  -&nbsp;one of these&nbsp;class in the core assembly is<br />
  constructed via Com interop by it's Name, and everything starts<br />
  it's life from there in their Add-in, much like a Main class in a<br />
  WinForms project.<br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>
  So the core assembly references the support assemblies, and has<br />
  no problem creating controls at runtime within these<br />
  assemblies...<br />
<&#47;p></p>
<h2>
  But then...<br />
<&#47;h2></p>
<p>
  However, the design time support fails to construct or make use<br />
  of the custom designers... and doesn't blow up, it just<br />
  fails&nbsp;silently - personally I hate this kind of behaviour...<br />
  I like things to fail fast, in your face :)<br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>
  It appears&nbsp;the custom designer is never constructed because<br />
  the design time infrastructure&nbsp;fails to&nbsp;locate the<br />
  assembly it's held within, even though&nbsp;my code has<br />
  just&nbsp;created an instance of a control from the same said<br />
  assembly not an instant before... arghh!<br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>
  To my mind this is madness... I'm not passing a string reference<br />
  to the type, and the assembly is already loaded, it should be as<br />
  simple as using the Type in the attribute to create an instance<br />
  of the designer&nbsp;- looking at the internal implementation of<br />
  this attribute, I can see where it all goes terribly wrong:<br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>
  public <strong>DesignerAttribute<&#47;strong>(Type<br />
  designerType)<br &#47;><br />
  {<br &#47;><br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this.designerTypeName =<br />
  designerType.AssemblyQualifiedName;<br &#47;><br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this.designerBaseTypeName =<br />
  typeof(IDesigner).FullName;<br &#47;><br />
  }<br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>
  It's still a puzzle as to why this isn't being resolved... the<br />
  assembly is already loaded against the current AppDomain -&nbsp;I<br />
  guess I could mess with the fusion logger to figure it out, there<br />
  must be some subtle different - but I didn't have the time to<br />
  waste, so I just cheated, implementing an<br />
  <strong>AppDomain.AssemblyResolve<&#47;strong> event handler to take<br />
  care of returning the assembly that's already loaded when<br />
  matching against a set of pre-loaded assemblies.<br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>
  I think the silent failure is what annoys me the most, this is<br />
  something which could be easily introduced and might not be<br />
  imediately detected when performing a minor update... I'm still<br />
  not sure how I could write a test to detect it...<br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>
  Speaking of custom designers... I'm unimpressed by how most<br />
  custom designers are marked internal... especially for classes<br />
  that are designed to be subclassed... why the hell is the<br />
  <strong>ButtonBaseDesigner<&#47;strong> marked internal?<br />
<&#47;p></p>
