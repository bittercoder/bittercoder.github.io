<h2>
  The evil designer attribute ;o)<br>
</h2>
<p>
  I'm working on a project at the moment where the client want's an<br>
  "Add-in" for an existing piece of software... it's a COM interop<br>
  project, .Net 2.0 (and yes, it uses <a href="http://www.castleproject.org/">Castle</a>,&nbsp;IoC sits in<br>
  nicely with<br>
  the&nbsp;<strong>IServiceProvider</strong>&nbsp;:)&nbsp;and it<br>
  hosts a custom designer, and the add-ins must exist in their own<br>
  directory, outside of the host applications base directory.<br>
</p>
<p>
  At any rate, it's been working just fine so far, but today I was<br>
  trying to introduce some custom designers... and they weren't<br>
  being constructed... which highlighted some odd behaviour in the<br>
  design time support - I have 6 or so&nbsp;assemblies,&nbsp;most<br>
  are support assemblies, some containing&nbsp;controls and their<br>
  associated designers, something like this:<br>
</p>
<p>
  public class <strong>MyButtonDesigner</strong> :<br>
  <strong>ControlDesigner</strong> { ..}<br>
</p>
<p>
  [<strong>Designer</strong>(typeof(<strong>MyButtonDesigner</strong>))]<br></p>
<p>  public class <strong>MyCustomButton</strong> :<br>
  <strong>ButtonBase</strong> { .. }<br>
</p>
<p>
  And then there is the core assembly which hosts the design<br>
  surface etc. and contains a number of&nbsp; COM-visible classes<br>
  -&nbsp;one of these&nbsp;class in the core assembly is<br>
  constructed via Com interop by it's Name, and everything starts<br>
  it's life from there in their Add-in, much like a Main class in a<br>
  WinForms project.<br>
</p>
<p>
  So the core assembly references the support assemblies, and has<br>
  no problem creating controls at runtime within these<br>
  assemblies...<br>
</p>
<h2>
  But then...<br>
</h2>
<p>
  However, the design time support fails to construct or make use<br>
  of the custom designers... and doesn't blow up, it just<br>
  fails&nbsp;silently - personally I hate this kind of behaviour...<br>
  I like things to fail fast, in your face :)<br>
</p>
<p>
  It appears&nbsp;the custom designer is never constructed because<br>
  the design time infrastructure&nbsp;fails to&nbsp;locate the<br>
  assembly it's held within, even though&nbsp;my code has<br>
  just&nbsp;created an instance of a control from the same said<br>
  assembly not an instant before... arghh!<br>
</p>
<p>
  To my mind this is madness... I'm not passing a string reference<br>
  to the type, and the assembly is already loaded, it should be as<br>
  simple as using the Type in the attribute to create an instance<br>
  of the designer&nbsp;- looking at the internal implementation of<br>
  this attribute, I can see where it all goes terribly wrong:<br>
</p>
<p>
  public <strong>DesignerAttribute</strong>(Type<br>
  designerType)<br><br>
  {<br><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this.designerTypeName =<br>
  designerType.AssemblyQualifiedName;<br><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this.designerBaseTypeName =<br>
  typeof(IDesigner).FullName;<br><br>
  }<br>
</p>
<p>
  It's still a puzzle as to why this isn't being resolved... the<br>
  assembly is already loaded against the current AppDomain -&nbsp;I<br>
  guess I could mess with the fusion logger to figure it out, there<br>
  must be some subtle different - but I didn't have the time to<br>
  waste, so I just cheated, implementing an<br>
  <strong>AppDomain.AssemblyResolve</strong> event handler to take<br>
  care of returning the assembly that's already loaded when<br>
  matching against a set of pre-loaded assemblies.<br>
</p>
<p>
  I think the silent failure is what annoys me the most, this is<br>
  something which could be easily introduced and might not be<br>
  imediately detected when performing a minor update... I'm still<br>
  not sure how I could write a test to detect it...<br>
</p>
<p>
  Speaking of custom designers... I'm unimpressed by how most<br>
  custom designers are marked internal... especially for classes<br>
  that are designed to be subclassed... why the hell is the<br>
  <strong>ButtonBaseDesigner</strong> marked internal?<br>
</p>
