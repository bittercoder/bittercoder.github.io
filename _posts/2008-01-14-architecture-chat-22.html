<p>Sorry about the late write-up, been a little busy!</p>
<p>
  Small turn out, with 5 us in all, including new comer <a href="http://www.jamiepenney.co.nz">Jamie</a> - a recent graduate from<br>
  Auckland University, it was great to talk with someone just<br>
  entering the industry proper and I think everyone else found it<br>
  very interesting to hear about what's going on at Auckland<br>
  Uni.<br><br>
</p>
<p>
  So first off we discussed adventures with alternative licensing<br>
  products - Gareth had a few war stories, and mentioned he's<br>
  returned to using <a href="http://www.eziriz.com/">.Net<br>
  Reactor</a> and got a refund on the previous product he tried out<br>
  because it just wasn't living up to expectations, and had some<br>
  questionable weak points.<br><br>
</p>
<p>
  We talked about the <a href="http://www.itu.dk/research/c5/">C5<br>
  Generic Collection Library</a> - though none of us have attempted<br>
  to use them in anger, a few people had heard about them recently<br>
  because it seems to be doing the podcast/blog rounds, even though<br>
  the project first debuted at the start of 2006, and was in<br>
  development well before then.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The classes were developed at the IT University in Copenhagen,<br>
  and feature a large number of specialised collections, as well as<br>
  introducing features to provide event handlers and sliding views,<br>
  support for clearing collection ranges etc.<br>
</p>
<p>
  There is a recent video on MSDN Channel 9, which is worth a<br>
  <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=370368">watch</a><br>
  as well.<br><br>
</p>
<p>
  Because we didn't have it in our hands last year before I wrapped<br>
  up the Architecture Chat I discussed the <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/12/09/asp-net-3-5-extensions-ctp-preview-released.aspx">ASP.Net Web Extensions CTP</a>, mentioning the amount of<br>
  community interest in MVC and that the Data Services (Astoria) is<br>
  looking better and better.<br>
</p>
<p>
  From there we talked about the <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/MVCContrib">MVC Contrib. project</a><br>
  (and community) that's sprung up after the ASP.Net MVC release,<br>
  which is getting some New Zealander's attention around the world<br>
  because of their contributions of both an <a href="http://www.flanders.co.nz/blog/archive/2007/12/15/xsltviewengine-patch-submitted.aspx">XSLT</a> View engine and <a href="http://andrewpeters.net/2007/12/19/introducing-nhaml-an-aspnet-mvc-view-engine/">NHaml</a> View engine - the contrib project is also providing<br>
  integration with the popular IoC containers in .Net and a number<br>
  of other extensions.<br>
</p>
<p>
  I talked about F# parsing, and my explorations of writing parsers<br>
  in F#, especially after reading the <a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/12/10/Practical+Parsing+In+F.aspx">series<br>
  of posts</a> from <a href="http://devhawk.net/">DevHawk (Harry<br>
  Pierson)</a>, and experimenting with writing DSL's in F# by<br>
  hand.&nbsp; I think my next "goal" is to master integrating F#<br>
  libraries into my C# code, so I can commercialize on it and start<br>
  weaving it into my day to day tool set.<br><br>
</p>
<p>
  I'm not sure I articulated how elegant F# syntax can be - but<br>
  hand writing custom parsers in F# with the aid of Active Patterns<br>
  is much nicer then the equivalent in a language like C#, If<br>
  you're following the pragmatic programmer guidelines of learning<br>
  a language a year, you could do much worse than to learn F# for<br>
  2008, it certainly gives the brain a good workout :)<br><br>
</p>
<p>
  From their I mentioned <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/Pex/">PEX</a> for use in automated<br>
  white box testing - Jamie said he had worked on a 4<sup>th</sup><br>
  year project to do automated black box testing, and found it<br>
  interesting that white box testing of this nature could be made<br>
  viable/useful... PEX seems to have done it though.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Though it's not been made available to the general public as yet<br>
  (only academia) - I suggest having a listen to this hanselminutes<br>
  <a href="http://www.hanselminutes.com/default.aspx?ShowID=111">podcast</a>,<br>
  and then watching this <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/Pex/screencast.aspx">screencast</a><br>
  to get a better idea of just what PEX is doing/aiming to<br>
  achieve...<span style="">&nbsp;</span> I find the support for<br>
  mocking particularly interesting, as I'm always sceptical of<br>
  automated test generation, as it normally falls apart once you<br>
  start to work objects when have numerous injected dependencies<br>
  that are used by the class to do it's work.<br><br>
</p>
<p>
  Last of all I mentioned <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/">TeamCity</a> (JetBrains CI<br>
  &amp; Build server) Professional Edition <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/buy/edition_comparison.html">is<br>
  free</a>, and I've been starting to play with it - and<br>
  considering migrating over from my current CruiseControl.Net<br>
  setup for new projects, I'm going to trial it on a small project<br>
  and see if it's worth moving to for what I do.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Last of all - though I forgot to mention it at the time - I've<br>
  also been looking at <a href="https://jazz.net/pub/index.jsp">Jazz</a> (or more so Rational<br>
  Team Concert) lately, it certainly looks to resolve many of the<br>
  headaches I suffer with managing concurrent versions of products,<br>
  especially from the build server perspective - obviously anything<br>
  with the name "Rational" is to be feared by the small or micro<br>
  ISV because of prohibitive costs - but it's nice to see just how<br>
  they approach solving the problem, as shown in the video<br>
  "<a href="https://jazz.net/blog/index.php/2008/01/13/fixing-a-bug-in-a-previous-release/">fixing<br>
  a bug in a previous release</a>".<br><br>
</p>
<p>
  Not a bad start to the year, hopefully we can make the next one<br>
  bigger and better, and maybe get some more long-running<br>
  architectural discussions going on ... maybe around <a href="http://behaviour-driven.org/">Behavior Driven<br>
  Development/Design</a> or maybe <a href="http://www.featuredrivendevelopment.com/">Feature Driven<br>
  Development</a> and what makes it more suitable for fixed-price<br>
  jobs.<br><br>
</p>
<p>
  See you all next time!<br>
</p>
