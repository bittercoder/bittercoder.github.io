<p>Sorry about the late write-up, been a little busy!</p>
<p>
  Small turn out, with 5 us in all, including new comer <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.jamiepenney.co.nz">Jamie<&#47;a> - a recent graduate from<br />
  Auckland University, it was great to talk with someone just<br />
  entering the industry proper and I think everyone else found it<br />
  very interesting to hear about what's going on at Auckland<br />
  Uni.<br &#47;><br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>
  So first off we discussed adventures with alternative licensing<br />
  products - Gareth had a few war stories, and mentioned he's<br />
  returned to using <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.eziriz.com&#47;">.Net<br />
  Reactor<&#47;a> and got a refund on the previous product he tried out<br />
  because it just wasn't living up to expectations, and had some<br />
  questionable weak points.<br &#47;><br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>
  We talked about the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.itu.dk&#47;research&#47;c5&#47;">C5<br />
  Generic Collection Library<&#47;a> - though none of us have attempted<br />
  to use them in anger, a few people had heard about them recently<br />
  because it seems to be doing the podcast&#47;blog rounds, even though<br />
  the project first debuted at the start of 2006, and was in<br />
  development well before then.<br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>
  The classes were developed at the IT University in Copenhagen,<br />
  and feature a large number of specialised collections, as well as<br />
  introducing features to provide event handlers and sliding views,<br />
  support for clearing collection ranges etc.<br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>
  There is a recent video on MSDN Channel 9, which is worth a<br />
  <a href="http:&#47;&#47;channel9.msdn.com&#47;ShowPost.aspx?PostID=370368">watch<&#47;a><br />
  as well.<br &#47;><br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>
  Because we didn't have it in our hands last year before I wrapped<br />
  up the Architecture Chat I discussed the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;weblogs.asp.net&#47;scottgu&#47;archive&#47;2007&#47;12&#47;09&#47;asp-net-3-5-extensions-ctp-preview-released.aspx">ASP.Net Web Extensions CTP<&#47;a>, mentioning the amount of<br />
  community interest in MVC and that the Data Services (Astoria) is<br />
  looking better and better.<br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>
  From there we talked about the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.codeplex.com&#47;MVCContrib">MVC Contrib. project<&#47;a><br />
  (and community) that's sprung up after the ASP.Net MVC release,<br />
  which is getting some New Zealander's attention around the world<br />
  because of their contributions of both an <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.flanders.co.nz&#47;blog&#47;archive&#47;2007&#47;12&#47;15&#47;xsltviewengine-patch-submitted.aspx">XSLT<&#47;a> View engine and <a href="http:&#47;&#47;andrewpeters.net&#47;2007&#47;12&#47;19&#47;introducing-nhaml-an-aspnet-mvc-view-engine&#47;">NHaml<&#47;a> View engine - the contrib project is also providing<br />
  integration with the popular IoC containers in .Net and a number<br />
  of other extensions.<br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>
  I talked about F# parsing, and my explorations of writing parsers<br />
  in F#, especially after reading the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;devhawk.net&#47;2007&#47;12&#47;10&#47;Practical+Parsing+In+F.aspx">series<br />
  of posts<&#47;a> from <a href="http:&#47;&#47;devhawk.net&#47;">DevHawk (Harry<br />
  Pierson)<&#47;a>, and experimenting with writing DSL's in F# by<br />
  hand.&nbsp; I think my next "goal" is to master integrating F#<br />
  libraries into my C# code, so I can commercialize on it and start<br />
  weaving it into my day to day tool set.<br &#47;><br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>
  I'm not sure I articulated how elegant F# syntax can be - but<br />
  hand writing custom parsers in F# with the aid of Active Patterns<br />
  is much nicer then the equivalent in a language like C#, If<br />
  you're following the pragmatic programmer guidelines of learning<br />
  a language a year, you could do much worse than to learn F# for<br />
  2008, it certainly gives the brain a good workout :)<br &#47;><br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>
  From their I mentioned <a href="http:&#47;&#47;research.microsoft.com&#47;Pex&#47;">PEX<&#47;a> for use in automated<br />
  white box testing - Jamie said he had worked on a 4<sup>th<&#47;sup><br />
  year project to do automated black box testing, and found it<br />
  interesting that white box testing of this nature could be made<br />
  viable&#47;useful... PEX seems to have done it though.<br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>
  Though it's not been made available to the general public as yet<br />
  (only academia) - I suggest having a listen to this hanselminutes<br />
  <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.hanselminutes.com&#47;default.aspx?ShowID=111">podcast<&#47;a>,<br />
  and then watching this <a href="http:&#47;&#47;research.microsoft.com&#47;Pex&#47;screencast.aspx">screencast<&#47;a><br />
  to get a better idea of just what PEX is doing&#47;aiming to<br />
  achieve...<span style="">&nbsp;<&#47;span> I find the support for<br />
  mocking particularly interesting, as I'm always sceptical of<br />
  automated test generation, as it normally falls apart once you<br />
  start to work objects when have numerous injected dependencies<br />
  that are used by the class to do it's work.<br &#47;><br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>
  Last of all I mentioned <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.jetbrains.com&#47;teamcity&#47;">TeamCity<&#47;a> (JetBrains CI<br />
  &amp; Build server) Professional Edition <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.jetbrains.com&#47;teamcity&#47;buy&#47;edition_comparison.html">is<br />
  free<&#47;a>, and I've been starting to play with it - and<br />
  considering migrating over from my current CruiseControl.Net<br />
  setup for new projects, I'm going to trial it on a small project<br />
  and see if it's worth moving to for what I do.<br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>
  Last of all - though I forgot to mention it at the time - I've<br />
  also been looking at <a href="https:&#47;&#47;jazz.net&#47;pub&#47;index.jsp">Jazz<&#47;a> (or more so Rational<br />
  Team Concert) lately, it certainly looks to resolve many of the<br />
  headaches I suffer with managing concurrent versions of products,<br />
  especially from the build server perspective - obviously anything<br />
  with the name "Rational" is to be feared by the small or micro<br />
  ISV because of prohibitive costs - but it's nice to see just how<br />
  they approach solving the problem, as shown in the video<br />
  "<a href="https:&#47;&#47;jazz.net&#47;blog&#47;index.php&#47;2008&#47;01&#47;13&#47;fixing-a-bug-in-a-previous-release&#47;">fixing<br />
  a bug in a previous release<&#47;a>".<br &#47;><br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>
  Not a bad start to the year, hopefully we can make the next one<br />
  bigger and better, and maybe get some more long-running<br />
  architectural discussions going on ... maybe around <a href="http:&#47;&#47;behaviour-driven.org&#47;">Behavior Driven<br />
  Development&#47;Design<&#47;a> or maybe <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.featuredrivendevelopment.com&#47;">Feature Driven<br />
  Development<&#47;a> and what makes it more suitable for fixed-price<br />
  jobs.<br &#47;><br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>
  See you all next time!<br />
<&#47;p></p>
