    like the idea of doing more pair-programming - tying it into the arch chats may
    work (although some of us struggle to get out for a long lunch as it is!). I have
    heard of people doing coffee+code pre-work things... not sure if that would work
    for people?"

    I don't work in the CBD - so Mornings are not so great for me, though I think I might be working at least a couple of days in Town each week next year, at least while getting some new dev's on board, so that could definitely work.   RE: Before/After Architecture chat, I was more thinking of those people who don't attend the chat anyway, but might be able to sneak out from 10:30-11:30 on a Thursday to do some pair programming.

    I'm sure it's possible to pair remotely too, but I don't think that'd be a good idea until your comfortable pairing with that person in the same physical location :)

    Architecture Chat is this week at any rate, so I'm going to float it with whoever turns up, see if anyone is keen, and see what we can work out...

  content: I might be up for this,   possibly something workwise, or alternatively,
    I'd be keen to do some "metro / windows store app" programming to get up to
    speed.

<h2>Auckland Code Retreat</h2>
<p><a href="http://blog.bittercoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/677978896.jpg"><img src="http://blog.bittercoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/677978896.jpg" alt="" title="code retreat" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-83490174"></a></p>
<p><br><br>
The first <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Auckland-Code-retreat/">code retreat</a> in NZ (AFAIK) was organised by <a href="http://xaml.geek.nz/">Ian</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/kiwipom">@kiwipom</a>) on Saturday October 27th, and facilitated by the one and only <a href="http://coreyhaines.com/">Corey Haines</a>.</p>
<p>It was a great event - and I offer a big thanks to Ian, Corey and the sponsors, as well as the gracious hosts at the Bizdojo makerspace who diligently made coffee and kept us well fed.</p>
<p>The whole day was great, and I think a comment from a fellow attendee Josh Robb in the closing circle rang very true with me as well, in that I came away pleasantly surprised at how much relevance the sessions had to the day to day work I do.   Every time we commenced a new session, with some different constraints, I found myself thinking of code I've written in the past where the same challenges were faced, or problems such as primitive obsession perhaps led me away from discovering a far more suitable abstraction or approach to solving a problem.</p>
<p>Through the day I got to pair with people mostly in .Net (C#) - as well as with a scala developer (though we paired using Java) - and a good mix of developers at different experience levels (at one point I even found myself having to give a very brief crash-course in Lambda's to my pair who I guess was probably stuck working with older versions of Visual Studio/legacy code bases).</p>
<h2>Comfort</h2>
<p>I think one thing that surprised (but also, not really... ) was how 'comfortable' I've got in the last 7 years, since I started working from home.</p>
<p>I'm not talking comfortable i.e. lazy / set in my ways - the last 7 years I've spent working from various home-office's have probably been some of the busiest times of my life, with lots of challenging tasks.  And I certainly keep myself busy talking to other developers, sharing experiences and trying to learn from others.  </p>
<p>But what I mean is comfortable in my working environment...</p>
<p>Over the years I have slowly reduced my tech life down to:</p>
<ul>
<li>A fast Desktop PC.</li>
<li>Lots of screen space (3 x 30" monitors + sometimes some additional smaller screens)</li>
<li>A good full-sized keyboard (currently using a daskeyboard, though the previous Logitched G15 I had was also good for other reasons).</li>
<li>Full size mouse (or a mouse at all).</li>
<li>Windows.</li>
<li>Resharper</li>
<li>Coding largely in isolation.</li>
<li>Using a laptop probably once every couple of months.</li>
<li>Largely working on brown fields projects.</li><br>
</ul>
<p>So when it came to pairing on laptops throughout the day (and deleting my code every 45 minutes) I found:</p>
<ul>
<li>My muscle memory for different laptop keyboard layouts was non-existent.</li>
<li>I really struggled with laptop keyboard cramping/typing accuracy</li>
<li>My Mac keyboard knowledge is very poor - and same goes for my knowledge of Elicpse shortcut keys.</li>
<li>I struggle to work around Visual Studio without ReSharper, and my ReSharper keyboard short cuts are somewhat non-standard.</li>
<li>I struggle with a single screen (I generally work with test + code side-by-side on one large screen, and the test runner on another).</li>
<li>I wasted time setting up test frameworks etc. unnecessarily (A force of habit coming from my brown-fields background) - when I could just have easily written a single-line Assert method that throws an exception and been done with it - and had a few extra minutes to focus on the actual problem.</li>
<li>I wasn't great an articulating my ideas to other developers necessarily</li><br>
</ul>
<p>This all lent itself towards a feeling of general uneasiness.  But the good, motivating kind, if you catch my drift.  The up-side of the code-retreat session is that deleting your code after 45 minutes makes it easier to forget the uneasiness and clear your mind ready for the next session.</p>
<h2>So What?</h2>
<p>Well I think I came away overall with a stronger desire to start pairing with people more often. The 45 minute session format really surprised me - it may not be long enough to necessarily solve the problem, but it's a great length of time to learn something / hone your craft around a particular constraint.</p>
<p>And it's certainly pushed me into trying and see if I can fit at least 1 session of pair-programming into my weekly routine if at all possible.</p>
<p>One Idea I have is perhaps pairing with somebody either immediately before or after the Architecture Chat that's run every second Thursday... so if anyone is in town and keen for a quick hour of pair-programming, let me know and perhaps we can catch up :)</p>
