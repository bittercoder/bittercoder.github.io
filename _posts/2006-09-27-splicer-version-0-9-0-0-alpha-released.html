<p>Over the past couple of days I've been working on using DirectShow<br>
and DES (DirectShow Editing Services) for re-encoding mobile video<br>
content suitable for posting on the web... With the goal of<br>
including video editing into our unified "media engine" which the<br>
Syzmk line of products makes use of... as an off-shoot of that work<br>
I decided to refactor the rather ugly code we had for working with<br>
DES over the weekend into something a little less ugly, that hid<br>
most of the details away, say hello to:<br><br>
<br><br>

<br><br>
<i>(sorry, couldn't resist the lame web 2.0 logo ;o)</i><br><br>
<br><br>
A simple little library for doing most of the useful things in DES,<br>
the project is hosted <a target="_blank" titlesrc="Splicer homepage on Codeplex" href="http://www.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName=splicer">here</a><br>
up on <a title="Codeplex" href="http://www.codeplex.com/">Codeplex</a>.&nbsp; It's currently in an<br>
alpha state, at version 0.9.0.0 - and should get feature drops<br>
every week or so until I think it can go into beta.<br><br>
<br><br>
To give an idea of what I'm up to, it's basically just wrapping up<br>
the various DES components and removing alot of the unpleasantness<br>
(ie. you get to deal with human-friendly units of time like<br>
seconds) .. and seperating the concerns of the timeline, and<br>
rendering that timeline into something useful like audio or video<br>
container (currently that's just WAV, AVI &amp; Windows Media<br>
formats).&nbsp; It's fully functional, but the interfaces at this<br>
point it isn't very stable as I'm likely to refactor the various<br>
interfaces mercilessly till I get it working how I want, so if you<br>
build something with the library now, it's likely to break in the<br>
future (but probably not in major way, it is after all mirroring<br>
the functionality available in DES).&nbsp;&nbsp; The added bonus of<br>
developing a set of rich wrappers for a lot of this stuff is that I<br>
can mock away the requirement on DES altogether, which is always a<br>
bonus considering how long the units tests currently take to run<br>
for the Syzmk RMP product.<br><br>
<br><br>
When I get a chance, I'll put up some code examples to demonstrate<br>
how you might use it... At any rate it'll be going through some dog<br>
fooding in the next month or so while I integrate it with the Syzmk<br>
product, so you'll probably here a little more about in the<br>
future.<br></p>
