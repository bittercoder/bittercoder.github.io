<h2>Cast your mind back...</h2><br>
If you recall (maybe you don't) there was some discussion a while<br>
back about <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/">Codplex,</a> TFS and&nbsp;the fact that it's a bit of a wash for creating an collaborative&nbsp;environment for an open source project... why?&nbsp; Well because&nbsp;of the chasm between developers for the project and those users who&nbsp;wish to collaborate by providing small patches, or working on the&nbsp;bleeding edge (i.e. checking out changes since the last time they&nbsp;build your project from source)
<p>Just to recap the big problems were:</p>
<ul>
<li>No support for patches</li>
<li>No anonymous check-outs</li>
<li>No easy way to diff/merge between your version and the latest&nbsp;version on source control (because you could only get the source&nbsp;as a tarball).</li><br>
</ul><br>
In particular I remember <a href="http://www.ayende.com/">Ayendes</a> posts on the subject, which&nbsp;sparked a bit of debate on the whole issue (and even got some&nbsp;feedback from the codeplex developers themselves...)
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.ayende.com/Blog/archive/6904.aspx">Codeplex&nbsp;WTF</a></li>

<h2>Codeplex's new command line client</h2><br>
Well it looks like one small step has been taken this week,&nbsp;check out this <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/codeplex/archive/2007/03/26/announcing-the-codeplex-source-control-client.aspx"><br>
entry</a> on the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/codeplex/">codeplex&nbsp;blog</a> ... There is now a .Net 2.0 command-line client being&nbsp;developed, which will include support for:
<ul>
<li>Anonymous checkouts (hurray! dragging down a tar ball every&nbsp;time there were changes... what an arse that is/was)</li>
<li>Merging</li>
<li>Patching</li><br>
</ul><br>
I got all excited (well as excited as you can be about a&nbsp;command line client for TFS) and grabbed the beta... really all I&nbsp;cared about was anonymous checkouts... I like my open source medium&nbsp;rare (mmm... nothing like a fresh check-out of <a href="http://www.castleproject.org/">castle</a>... release candidates<br>
never have any of the fun stuff!)
<p>But my hopes were dashed - it appears there's no way to skip the&nbsp;authorisation check as far as I can see, and when supplying my own&nbsp;credentials I didn't have access:</p>
<blockquote><p>c:devtoolscodeplex_client></p>
<p>cpc co reflectoraddins:/ c:devresourcesreflector</p>
<p>_addins</p>
<p>Username [sndanonymous_cp]: bittercoder</p>
<p>Password for bittercoder: ********</p>
<p>error: TF50309: You do not have sufficient permissions to perform<br>
this operation</p>
<p>. ---> Attempted to perform an unauthorized operation.</p></blockquote><br>
I guess there's a little more waiting to go&nbsp;yet...
<p>Still, not to get too disheartended I decided to try it on a&nbsp;project I coordinate for (ye olde <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/splicer/">Splicer</a>...) and I can&nbsp;certainly confirm it works... considering that the command line&nbsp;tools are less than 200K, this is already a great improvement over&nbsp;the current situtation... (about 250mb to download Team Explorer's&nbsp;iso).</p>
<blockquote><p>c:devtoolscodeplex_client></p>
<p>cpc co splicer:/ c:devhomesplicer_copy</p>
<p>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c:devhomesplicer_copy</p>
<p>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c:devhomesplicer_copysrc</p>
<p>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c:devhomesplicer_copysrcASL - Apache<br>
Software Foundation License.txt</p>
<p>.... and so on ;o)</p></blockquote>
<p>So as you can see ... it does work... but I have to say it's pretty&nbsp;damn slow (could just be because I'm in New Zealand of&nbsp;course).</p>
<p>At any rate... I'll be keeping my eye on it... there may be hope&nbsp;for codeplex yet ;o)</p>
<p>... and on one last note... the gui check-in looks a little like&nbsp;TortoiseSVN don't you think... &nbsp;hopefully the work towards some&nbsp;feature parity there.</p>
