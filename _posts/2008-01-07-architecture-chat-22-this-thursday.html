<p>So, the Sylvia Park <a href="http://wiki.bittercoder.com/SylviaParkArchitectureChats.ashx">Architecture&nbsp;Chat</a> is back for 2008 - To be held this Thursday, 11:30am at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.garrisonpub.co.nz/default.aspx">Garrisons</a>&nbsp;in Sylvia Park.</p>
<p>Some possible topics for discussion are listed below, though feel&nbsp;free to suggest additional topics either via a comment on this post&nbsp;or email - I haven't been keeping much of an eye on technology over&nbsp;the xmas break.</p>
<ul>
<li>ASP.Net Web Extensions CTP Preview Was <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/12/09/asp-net-3-5-extensions-ctp-preview-released.aspx">Released</a>, including MVC, Dynamic Data Support (scaffolding&nbsp;*yawn*), Silverlight extensions &amp; Data Services (Astoria).</li>
<li><a href="http://www.codeplex.com/MVCContrib">MvcContrib</a>&nbsp;project sparked off - adding <a href="http://nvelocity.sourceforge.net/">NVelocity</a>, <a href="http://andrewpeters.net/2007/12/19/introducing-nhaml-an-aspnet-mvc-view-engine/">NHaml</a> (developed by Andrew Peters) and <a href="http://www.flanders.co.nz/blog/archive/2007/12/15/xsltviewengine-patch-submitted.aspx">Xslt</a>&nbsp; (Developed by Ivan Porto Carrero) view engines&nbsp;to the ASP.Net MVC project as well as providing integration&nbsp;with a select number of IoC containers and other improvements&nbsp;to make the ASP.Net MVC CTP easier to work with i.e. convention&nbsp;over configuration.</li>
<li>The Castle Refactor - Monorail is getting an overhaul in the&nbsp;Castle Project, and they are in the process of moving to the&nbsp;NHibernate (2.0) Trunk as well.&nbsp; Hopefully it will make my&nbsp;guide to running with the "<a href="http://wiki.bittercoder.com/CastleStackFromTrunk.ashx">trunks</a>"&nbsp;largely obsolete.</li>
<li><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/archive/2007/11/29/parallel-extensions-to-the-net-fx-ctp.aspx">Parallel FX CTP</a> - We didn't talk about this last time,&nbsp;might be worth giving it a look.</li>
<li>Practical F# Parsing - I mentioned a little bit about parsing&nbsp;with F# at the last Architecture, and this series I've been&nbsp;watching with interest as it's covered off implementing a&nbsp;<a href="http://devhawk.net/2007/12/10/Practical+Parsing+In+F.aspx">PEG parser with F#</a> -writing Parsers with F# is pretty slick<br />
compared to object oriented languages.</li></p>
<li><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/default.aspx">Internet&nbsp;Explorer 8</a> announcements.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.drury.net.nz/">Rod Drury</a> - For anyone&nbsp;involved in a startup from day one I'm sure we can give these&nbsp;series of posts (<a href="http://www.drury.net.nz/2008/01/05/1-of-6-i-have-an-idea-but-how-do-i-know-its-a-business/">1</a>,<a href="http://www.drury.net.nz/2008/01/07/2-of-6-the-shareholders-agreement/">2</a>&nbsp;&amp; <a href="http://www.drury.net.nz/2008/01/08/3-of-6-your-pitch-document/">3</a> of 6 so far) a definite head nod (or a long drawn out<br />
sigh for guidance arriving to late ;o)</li><br />
</ul><br />
See you all there!</p>
