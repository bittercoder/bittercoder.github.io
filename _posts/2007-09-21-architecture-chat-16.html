<p>Quite a good turnout, with well over a table full (I didn't take an&nbsp;official count, but I'm guessing around 12 or more) including&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.base4.net&#47;">Alex James<&#47;a> and <a href="http:&#47;&#47;designingcode.blogspot.com&#47;">Keith<&#47;a> (who we hadn't seen&nbsp;for a while) and two newcomers from <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.olympic.co.nz&#47;">Olympic Software<&#47;a>, which was great -&nbsp;we always like to see fresh faces and ideas.</p>
<p>I talked very briefly about <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.castleproject.org&#47;index.html">Castle Project<&#47;a> RC3 -&nbsp;I suggested it was a week or two away from getting out the door,&nbsp;but in fact - It's out as of about an hour ago! (11:30am) - the&nbsp;website and documentation is still in the process of being updated,&nbsp;but the installer and binaries&#47;source are <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.castleproject.org&#47;castle&#47;download.html">all&nbsp;here<&#47;a>.</p>
<p>I was going to run through some of the changes I like in RC3 - but&nbsp;the conversation got steered away before I got warmed up - but it's&nbsp;well worth checking out, if you haven't been keeping an eye on the&nbsp;trunk and the changes that have been going in.</p>
<p>At any rate - this is the culmination of a huge amount of work from&nbsp;many of the Castle contributors, I think it even has a 2 line patch&nbsp;of my own in there somewhere :P ... great work guys!</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;msdn.microsoft.com&#47;msdnmag&#47;issues&#47;07&#47;10&#47;PLINQ&#47;default.aspx"><br />
PLINQ<&#47;a> - talked about PLINQ getting closer, and the fact that&nbsp;parallelization is a very hot topic of late, with a few noting that&nbsp;the last MSDN mag was almost entirely focused on this&nbsp;subject.</p>
<p>On a tangent, <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.erlang.org&#47;">Erlang<&#47;a> cropped,&nbsp;not too many of us have had exposure to the language details, but&nbsp;Keith had done some spelunking and gave us a quick rundown of how&nbsp;it all hangs together, definitely something to keep an eye on -&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;andrewpeters.net&#47;">Andrew Peter's<&#47;a> even called<br />
it his <a href="http:&#47;&#47;andrewpeters.net&#47;2007&#47;08&#47;19&#47;my-language-of-the-year&#47;">"Language&nbsp;of the year"<&#47;a>.</p>
<p>I brought up the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.mediadefender.com&#47;">MediaDefender<&#47;a> debacle that's&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.news.com&#47;Leaked-e-mails-reveal-MediaDefenders-antipiracy-woes&#47;2100-1027_3-6209084.html?tag=nefd.top">been<&#47;a> unravelling <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.boingboing.net&#47;2007&#47;09&#47;20&#47;mediadefender-sends.html">over<&#47;a>&nbsp;the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.techdirt.com&#47;articles&#47;20070916&#47;210351.shtml">last<&#47;a><br />
week or so since their huge mail leak.&nbsp; Not only are the inner&nbsp;workings of this organisation pretty unprofessional and certainly&nbsp;bordering on unethical for a corporation, but it highlights the&nbsp;risk most organisations run - the source of the leak being one&nbsp;employee who automatically forwarded all his work email to a gmail&nbsp;account, who then used the exact same credentials elsewhere.</p>
<p>Keith gave us some insight into <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.lua.org&#47;">LUA<&#47;a>, including why it doesn't make an&nbsp;attractive language to port to .Net, and why it's so much easier to&nbsp;embed in a C++ based project as opposed to something like Ruby,&nbsp;which just seem to be designed for that purpose, especially with&nbsp;it's "out of the box" set of global variables.</p>
<p>I asked the question "What web load testing apps do you use" - and&nbsp;the answer was generally, <strong>we don't<&#47;strong>!... I've been reviewing&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.webload.org&#47;">WebLOAD<&#47;a> - which looks quite&nbsp;good, especially because the load machines can be deployed on a non&nbsp;Microsoft machine, such as Linux, making it easier to span a number&nbsp;of load machines out on something like <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;gp&#47;browse.html?node=201590011">Amazons&nbsp;elastic cloud (EC2)<&#47;a>, or low-cost machines without the hassle of&nbsp;O&#47;S licensing.</p>
<p>We then moved onto talking about high-scale load testing, i.e.&nbsp;simulating a million simultaneous requests - somebody suggested&nbsp;that maybe you could hire whoever's pulling the strings on the&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Storm_botnet">Storm&nbsp;BotNet<&#47;a> - though I'm not sure they're into self-promotion&nbsp;;o)</p>
<p>We talked about social networking applications, and leveraging&nbsp;social networking platforms with <a href="http:&#47;&#47;developers.facebook.com&#47;">API's<&#47;a> such as <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;gp&#47;browse.html?node=201590011">face&nbsp;book<&#47;a>, this has been a popular topic over the last couple of&nbsp;months, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finding the killer app(s) that could leverage an API like&nbsp;face book's, and making money out of it.<&#47;li>
<li>Bad habits encouraged by these platforms, such as requesting&nbsp;your email account username and password to "email your friends".<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
Alex James brought up the great series of posts that Rowan&nbsp;Simpson has been making lately - not everyone knew who Rowan was...&nbsp;so hopefully they should know now ;o) the posts walk through, the&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;rowansimpson.com&#47;2007&#47;09&#47;16&#47;trade-me-manifesto&#47;">Trade me&nbsp;manifesto<&#47;a>, and then drills into:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http:&#47;&#47;rowansimpson.com&#47;2007&#47;09&#47;16&#47;1-create-great-websites-and-people-will-tell-their-friends&#47;">Create great websites and people will tell their friends<&#47;a><&#47;li>
<li><a href="http:&#47;&#47;rowansimpson.com&#47;2007&#47;09&#47;17&#47;2-be-like-electricity&#47;">Be&nbsp;like electricity<&#47;a><&#47;li>
<li><a href="http:&#47;&#47;rowansimpson.com&#47;2007&#47;09&#47;19&#47;3-let-the-server-run-the-business&#47;">Let the server run the business<&#47;a><&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
Over lunch we talked about many things, mostly non-IT related,&nbsp;but some things that did come up, including that the Mac OS&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;db.tidbits.com&#47;article&#47;9192">isn't going to have a&nbsp;NZ Daylight savings time update<&#47;a> before Daylight savings&nbsp;actually kicks in, though <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.mactcp.org.nz&#47;nzdt.html">it's not really a&nbsp;problem.<&#47;a></p>
<p>Some things that got mentioned which I didn't quite catch the&nbsp;details of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Metabase (I'm not sure I got the name right - couldn't find a&nbsp;link, but apparently it's a game &#47; game development platform, in&nbsp;alpha development at the moment, where all game assets have an&nbsp;associated URL, and maybe an RSS Feed??) - Alex James suggested&nbsp;it might be interesting to combine something like that with a web&nbsp;based data storage platform, such as <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.freebase.com&#47;">freebase<&#47;a>, developed by <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.metaweb.com&#47;">Metaweb Tech<&#47;a>.<&#47;li>
<li>Jason K (Knowles?) - who apparently supports the Idea of&nbsp;every user having there own domain, to cement their various web&nbsp;identities together, and where all their data is held by them in&nbsp;one place. - can anyone throw me the correct name and url?<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul></p>
