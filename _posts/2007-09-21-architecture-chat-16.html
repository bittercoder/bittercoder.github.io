<p>Quite a good turnout, with well over a table full (I didn't take an&nbsp;official count, but I'm guessing around 12 or more) including&nbsp;<a href="http://www.base4.net/">Alex James</a> and <a href="http://designingcode.blogspot.com/">Keith</a> (who we hadn't seen&nbsp;for a while) and two newcomers from <a href="http://www.olympic.co.nz/">Olympic Software</a>, which was great -&nbsp;we always like to see fresh faces and ideas.</p>
<p>I talked very briefly about <a href="http://www.castleproject.org/index.html">Castle Project</a> RC3 -&nbsp;I suggested it was a week or two away from getting out the door,&nbsp;but in fact - It's out as of about an hour ago! (11:30am) - the&nbsp;website and documentation is still in the process of being updated,&nbsp;but the installer and binaries/source are <a href="http://www.castleproject.org/castle/download.html">all&nbsp;here</a>.</p>
<p>I was going to run through some of the changes I like in RC3 - but&nbsp;the conversation got steered away before I got warmed up - but it's&nbsp;well worth checking out, if you haven't been keeping an eye on the&nbsp;trunk and the changes that have been going in.</p>
<p>At any rate - this is the culmination of a huge amount of work from&nbsp;many of the Castle contributors, I think it even has a 2 line patch&nbsp;of my own in there somewhere :P ... great work guys!</p>
<p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/07/10/PLINQ/default.aspx"><br />
PLINQ</a> - talked about PLINQ getting closer, and the fact that&nbsp;parallelization is a very hot topic of late, with a few noting that&nbsp;the last MSDN mag was almost entirely focused on this&nbsp;subject.</p>
<p>On a tangent, <a href="http://www.erlang.org/">Erlang</a> cropped,&nbsp;not too many of us have had exposure to the language details, but&nbsp;Keith had done some spelunking and gave us a quick rundown of how&nbsp;it all hangs together, definitely something to keep an eye on -&nbsp;<a href="http://andrewpeters.net/">Andrew Peter's</a> even called<br />
it his <a href="http://andrewpeters.net/2007/08/19/my-language-of-the-year/">"Language&nbsp;of the year"</a>.</p>
<p>I brought up the <a href="http://www.mediadefender.com/">MediaDefender</a> debacle that's&nbsp;<a href="http://www.news.com/Leaked-e-mails-reveal-MediaDefenders-antipiracy-woes/2100-1027_3-6209084.html?tag=nefd.top">been</a> unravelling <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2007/09/20/mediadefender-sends.html">over</a>&nbsp;the <a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20070916/210351.shtml">last</a><br />
week or so since their huge mail leak.&nbsp; Not only are the inner&nbsp;workings of this organisation pretty unprofessional and certainly&nbsp;bordering on unethical for a corporation, but it highlights the&nbsp;risk most organisations run - the source of the leak being one&nbsp;employee who automatically forwarded all his work email to a gmail&nbsp;account, who then used the exact same credentials elsewhere.</p>
<p>Keith gave us some insight into <a href="http://www.lua.org/">LUA</a>, including why it doesn't make an&nbsp;attractive language to port to .Net, and why it's so much easier to&nbsp;embed in a C++ based project as opposed to something like Ruby,&nbsp;which just seem to be designed for that purpose, especially with&nbsp;it's "out of the box" set of global variables.</p>
<p>I asked the question "What web load testing apps do you use" - and&nbsp;the answer was generally, <strong>we don't</strong>!... I've been reviewing&nbsp;<a href="http://www.webload.org/">WebLOAD</a> - which looks quite&nbsp;good, especially because the load machines can be deployed on a non&nbsp;Microsoft machine, such as Linux, making it easier to span a number&nbsp;of load machines out on something like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html?node=201590011">Amazons&nbsp;elastic cloud (EC2)</a>, or low-cost machines without the hassle of&nbsp;O/S licensing.</p>
<p>We then moved onto talking about high-scale load testing, i.e.&nbsp;simulating a million simultaneous requests - somebody suggested&nbsp;that maybe you could hire whoever's pulling the strings on the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_botnet">Storm&nbsp;BotNet</a> - though I'm not sure they're into self-promotion&nbsp;;o)</p>
<p>We talked about social networking applications, and leveraging&nbsp;social networking platforms with <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/">API's</a> such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html?node=201590011">face&nbsp;book</a>, this has been a popular topic over the last couple of&nbsp;months, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finding the killer app(s) that could leverage an API like&nbsp;face book's, and making money out of it.</li>
<li>Bad habits encouraged by these platforms, such as requesting&nbsp;your email account username and password to "email your friends".</li><br />
</ul><br />
Alex James brought up the great series of posts that Rowan&nbsp;Simpson has been making lately - not everyone knew who Rowan was...&nbsp;so hopefully they should know now ;o) the posts walk through, the&nbsp;<a href="http://rowansimpson.com/2007/09/16/trade-me-manifesto/">Trade me&nbsp;manifesto</a>, and then drills into:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://rowansimpson.com/2007/09/16/1-create-great-websites-and-people-will-tell-their-friends/">Create great websites and people will tell their friends</a></li>
<li><a href="http://rowansimpson.com/2007/09/17/2-be-like-electricity/">Be&nbsp;like electricity</a></li>
<li><a href="http://rowansimpson.com/2007/09/19/3-let-the-server-run-the-business/">Let the server run the business</a></li><br />
</ul><br />
Over lunch we talked about many things, mostly non-IT related,&nbsp;but some things that did come up, including that the Mac OS&nbsp;<a href="http://db.tidbits.com/article/9192">isn't going to have a&nbsp;NZ Daylight savings time update</a> before Daylight savings&nbsp;actually kicks in, though <a href="http://www.mactcp.org.nz/nzdt.html">it's not really a&nbsp;problem.</a></p>
<p>Some things that got mentioned which I didn't quite catch the&nbsp;details of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Metabase (I'm not sure I got the name right - couldn't find a&nbsp;link, but apparently it's a game / game development platform, in&nbsp;alpha development at the moment, where all game assets have an&nbsp;associated URL, and maybe an RSS Feed??) - Alex James suggested&nbsp;it might be interesting to combine something like that with a web&nbsp;based data storage platform, such as <a href="http://www.freebase.com/">freebase</a>, developed by <a href="http://www.metaweb.com/">Metaweb Tech</a>.</li>
<li>Jason K (Knowles?) - who apparently supports the Idea of&nbsp;every user having there own domain, to cement their various web&nbsp;identities together, and where all their data is held by them in&nbsp;one place. - can anyone throw me the correct name and url?</li><br />
</ul></p>
