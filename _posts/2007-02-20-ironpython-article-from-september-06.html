<p>Came across a short piece I wrote about IronPython while looking&nbsp;for something else - it was in response to some questions from&nbsp;Kathleen Richards in September of last year for <a href="http://reddevnews.com/">Redmond Developer News</a> (which I think&nbsp;was for this <a href="http://reddevnews.com/news/devnews/article.aspx?editorialsid=100">Article</a>,&nbsp;though none of the content made it in - cest la vie).</p>
<p>At any rate, I figure I might as well post it here, it may be of&nbsp;use to someone... somewhere... who could say?&nbsp; Looking over it&nbsp;briefly I'm not even sure I agree with some of the points I made&nbsp;any more :P</p>

<h1>IronPython Article</h1></p>
<h2>
How are you using IronPython?</h2><br />
At Syzmk (<a href="http://www.syzmk.com/">http://www.syzmk.com/</a>) we are using&nbsp;IronPython as a rich embedded scripting language within our core&nbsp;product, we expose a large part of the .Net server engine (written&nbsp;in C#) to the IronPython runtime, and offer key extension points&nbsp;which can be hooked into with python code - we chose python because&nbsp;the language is rich, dynamic and doesn't suffer from the verbosity&nbsp;that most of the compiled languages do.&nbsp;&nbsp; At the moment&nbsp;we are moving beyond using IronPython as just an embedded scripting&nbsp;language and are evaluating how best to implement a number of&nbsp;domain specific languages in it for our server, firstly around the&nbsp;business rules and behavior of our application's core logic, and&nbsp;secondly for performance and diagnostic evaluation and control of&nbsp;the underlying server platform.</p>
<h2>Why did you choose this implementation over C python or Jython or<br />
other dynamic languages?</h2><br />
IronPython was attractive because of its first class support&nbsp;for .Net types and especially its excellent support for delegates&nbsp;(and because there wasn't any marshalling) - we were attracted to&nbsp;the python syntax and language structure, more than support for the&nbsp;standard python libraries, so the compatibility sacrifices that&nbsp;were apparent with many C Python libraries, especially during the&nbsp;beta, were of little consequence to us, especially as IronPython&nbsp;has full access to the base class libraries (BCL).</p>
<h2>What types of applications are you building?</h2><br />
The core application we have used IronPython for is a server&nbsp;technology, the "Rich Media Processor" (working title) - it's in&nbsp;production, but has only been going to market for the last 6&nbsp;months.&nbsp;&nbsp; Effectively you can place it into an&nbsp;organization as a front end processor for rich and largely&nbsp;unstructured messages (think Audio, Video, Email, SMS and MMS&nbsp;messages from phones, images dumped from digital cameras, security&nbsp;camera feeds etc) with the end result being a structured and&nbsp;conforming set of messages and rich content (appropriately&nbsp;formatted images, videos, audio etc) suitable for passing onto line&nbsp;of business systems, or a product like biz talk.</p>
<p>When dealing with transforming this kind of content, python (and&nbsp;IronPython) is a great language to augment the message&nbsp;transformation process - strong string support, access to all the&nbsp;functionality of our underlying application and it's easy to&nbsp;develop and deploy - IronPython never seems to be working against&nbsp;us, I could never claim the same for any scripting language I've&nbsp;implemented into a product before.</p>
<h2>Does the .NET environment offer any advantages?</h2><br />
Yes, I think it offers serious advantages for Python (access&nbsp;to the BCL!), developers and customers.</p>
<p>First off the business case for building .Net applications is&nbsp;immediate within our home country of New Zealand, customers are&nbsp;generally expecting to host Microsoft tools and solutions, and our&nbsp;IT industry is geared towards this expectation, there is an implied&nbsp;trust which is worth taking advantage of.</p>
<p>Business cases aside however I think the .Net platform is very&nbsp;engaging for us, our company has a love for technology, and in the&nbsp;last few years the .Net platform has been satisfying that need very&nbsp;well - it offers stability, security and productivity increases&nbsp;that we can't find elsewhere (and certainly not in an unmanaged&nbsp;language), also the language-agnostic approach and ability to build&nbsp;dynamic languages (like IronPython) in the CLR make the choice all&nbsp;that simpler.</p>
<h2>Disadvantages?</h2><br />
We haven't really discovered any disadvantages with .Net or&nbsp;our approach, IronPython does everything we need and then some, as&nbsp;does the .Net platform - however I think it might be some time yet&nbsp;before dynamic languages on the CLR (or any language other then&nbsp;VB.Net or C#) will be acceptable recommendations from the&nbsp;consulting masses - perhaps more a reflection on the lack of&nbsp;education and published case studies I think.</p>
<p>For instance we already have languages competing with C# on the&nbsp;.Net platform, such as Boo (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boo_programming_language">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boo_programming_language</a>),&nbsp;which offer some advantages over the current version of C# and are&nbsp;very suitable for building domain specific languages (DSL's) - but&nbsp;I believe in many bespoke development houses it would be very hard&nbsp;to get buy-in for using these languages in upcoming projects, even&nbsp;if they will save time and money or just be a better fit for their&nbsp;problems.</p>
<h2>Do you think dynamic, object oriented (scripting) languages<br />
(Ruby, Python) will start to play a larger role in enterprise<br />
development?</h2><br />
I think the short answer is yes, the languages are often just&nbsp;a catalyst for methodologies and practices (such as functional&nbsp;programming, or the ruby on rails web development approach) - the&nbsp;elegance, simplicity and speed at which dynamic language guru's can&nbsp;deliver results is enviable for a lot of us who have cut our teeth&nbsp;on C++ &amp; Java and known the other end of the spectrum.</p>
<h2>If I am in a corporate environment should I be looking into these<br />
languages?</h2><br />
I think at this point it should not be on the top of your list&nbsp;- if you're a Microsoft shop, or in an environment dedicated to&nbsp;employing solutions on top of Microsoft technologies then .Net 3.0&nbsp;should be your key focus - however I think it's certainly worth&nbsp;having a few dynamic language books at your disposal (perhaps on&nbsp;the bedside table), they make for compelling reading, and will get&nbsp;your initial buy-in, so you feel comfortable considering a dynamic&nbsp;language on the .Net platform as a good idea.</p>
<p>That said, if you're not a Microsoft shop, and particularly if you&nbsp;are committed to open-source technologies I would look seriously,&nbsp;probably first at Ruby, it's very engaging story - though of course&nbsp;you can run IronPython on Mono with a little bit of tweaking ? ...&nbsp;and IronRuby is getting better every day.</p>
<h2>What are some of the key issues from an application development<br />
standpoint?</h2><br />
I can only talk from the perspective of deploying IronPython&nbsp;as a scripting engine, hosted within another application, though&nbsp;some of these points will probably apply elsewhere, I think it all&nbsp;comes down to one thing -&nbsp; being prepared.</p>
<p>First off, you must change your point of view and adapt some of&nbsp;your practices, as they will confound you with the introduction of&nbsp;a scripting language that has access to your own .Net&nbsp;classes.&nbsp; As you develop classes, try them on for size and&nbsp;make sure the selected scripting language doesn't have trouble&nbsp;accessing them - for instance heavily overloaded .Net methods in&nbsp;IronPython can be a recipe for frustration later on, same goes with&nbsp;using multiple out or ref parameters - that's not to say IronPython&nbsp;can't access them, just that it's awkward and unpleasant (something&nbsp;your scripting language should not be).</p>
<p>Second to this is security - dynamic languages effectively&nbsp;introduce a surface area to your application that didn't exist&nbsp;before - our server allows configuration (including iron python&nbsp;scripts) to be applied via a web service - you want to make&nbsp;absolutely sure there is sufficient trust between endpoints, and&nbsp;don't repeat mistakes of the past with other scripting languages&nbsp;(think injection attacks).</p>
