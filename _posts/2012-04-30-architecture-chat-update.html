<p>So for those curious, the Architecture Chat is still going - I&nbsp;know the last post was on February 22nd... apologies for the&nbsp;slackness.</p>
<p>Currently we have been using Google Docs (after the demise of&nbsp;google wave) to arrange the chats, which all the regular folk get&nbsp;invited to (the document that is) - and just announcing the doc&nbsp;on Twitter (follow myself <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/bittercoder">@bittercoder</a> or the hash&nbsp;tag <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23ArchitectureChat">#ArchitectureChat</a>&nbsp;to see announcements of upcoming chats).</p>
<p>If your are a past regular/planning to come along more often in&nbsp;the future - then let me know your email address and I can start&nbsp;inviting you to the google doc as well.</p>
<p>In other news we have also relocated, with the chats now being&nbsp;held at <a href="http://benedictioncafe.co.nz/">Benediction<br>
Cafe</a>, in Newton.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is proving more Central for&nbsp;everyone, and should mean that people in the CBD can make it&nbsp;along more regularly (walking distance in some cases), plus the<br>
coffee is better!</p>
<p>To recap here are all the google docs for this year:</p>
