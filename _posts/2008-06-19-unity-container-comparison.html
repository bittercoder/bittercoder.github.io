  content: Yeah, I've certainly had projects that go that way as well, I was just
    thinking in regards to more mundane IoC usage... like repositories, services etc.
    in a Monorail&#47;MVC app.  I suppose being able to set a default lifestyle at
    the container level would probably solve the problem - though that defeats convention
    over configuration.

<p>If you recall many moons ago I posted a <a href="http:&#47;&#47;wiki.bittercoder.com&#47;Default.aspx?Page=ContainerTutorials">series&nbsp;of articles<&#47;a> on the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.castleproject.org&#47;container&#47;index.html">Castle&nbsp;Project's IOC Container<&#47;a> "Windsor" teaching the fundamentals of&nbsp;IoC with a practical bent - lots of people liked them, and I still&nbsp;get feedback every now and then from people starting to use windsor&nbsp;and finding them useful.</p>
<p>At any rate <a href="http:&#47;&#47;aardvarkblogs.wordpress.com&#47;">Michael&nbsp;McGuire<&#47;a> was once such person who read those tutorials a year or&nbsp;so ago and has now started a series of his own - mirroring my&nbsp;castle container tutorials but with the P&amp;P <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.codeplex.com&#47;unity">Unity<&#47;a> container instead - you&nbsp;can find it <a href="http:&#47;&#47;aardvarkblogs.wordpress.com&#47;">here<&#47;a>.</p>
<p>As someone who has not given Unity much more then a brief skim it's&nbsp;a nice way to quickly get up to speed on some of the key&nbsp;differences.</p>
<p>So far after reading a couple of articles I've learnt.</p>
<ul>
<li>You need to implement your own type converters for things&nbsp;like arrays or dictionaries in configuration.<&#47;li>
<li>Configuration syntax is not particularly human-friendly,&nbsp;obviously designed for management via a tool&nbsp; - requiring&nbsp;the entry of full types all over the spot like&nbsp;"Microsoft.Practices.Unity.Configuration.TypeInjectionElement,&nbsp;Microsoft.Practices.Unity.Configuration" - just to register a&nbsp;component!<&#47;li>
<li>Default lifestyle is transient... hmmm.. personally I think&nbsp;singleton is more-often the norm for me when writing&nbsp;applications, but it really depends on how the container is being&nbsp;used&#47;abused I guess.<&#47;li>
<li>Support for multiple configurations looks a little more baked&nbsp;in - but this is trivial stuff to implement in most&nbsp;containers.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
I'll be interested to see how decorator chains etc. are&nbsp;implemented in Unity.</p>
<p>Good work Michael.</p>
