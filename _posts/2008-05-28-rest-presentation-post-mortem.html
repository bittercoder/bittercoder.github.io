<p>Thanks to everyone for turning up at my REST presentation&nbsp;yesterday, much appreciated!</p>
<p>At any rate - a quick note to say that I'll tidy up the slide deck&nbsp;a little and post most of the examples in the next couple of&nbsp;days.</p>
<p>The OAuth code I'll publish in a week or two as a seperate&nbsp;open-source project...&nbsp; probably on googlecode or codeplex...&nbsp;and I'll break out the dependencies on the Castle stack so that&nbsp;it'll be usable for a general range of consumer / provider&nbsp;implementations (i.e. vanilla ASP.Net etc.)</p>
<p>Oh and appologies if I was a little vague - I was running on empty&nbsp;(have the flu quite bad and haven't really slept all week).</p>
