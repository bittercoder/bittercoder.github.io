    I've got an old laptop that might do the trick... given a day or so I could probably write a simple "clock-os" in assembler and boot-strap it, no doubt a great use of my time.

    It still puzzles me why the clock stopped in the first place, yet I could access the date/time settings by clicking on it... even logging on/off didn't fix it - had to reboot... puzzling!

My vista64 clock has stopped in the system tray... the funny thing<br>
is Renee (My Fiancee for those who don't know) has been asking me<br>
for the last half hour what the time is... and I've kept responding<br>
almost 11:30...<br><br>
<br><br>
I hope they fix that in Vista SP1 - Damned if I'm getting a wall<br>
clock for my office!<br><br>
