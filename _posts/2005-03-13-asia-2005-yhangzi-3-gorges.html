<p>Hi guys, sorry about the lack of updates.. I've been on the road&nbsp;a lot since my last update and haven't been able to post an entry&nbsp;about the time I've spent over the last few days (or even&nbsp;shower... eww)</p>
<p>At some point I'll back track and say a little about Guilin and&nbsp;the outlying areas (where I was before now) - but for now I'm&nbsp;just going to talk about the 3 gorges where I've spent the last 3&nbsp;days.</p>
<p>We arrived at the boat after a 2 hour bus ride from Guangzhou and&nbsp;a look at the 3 gorges damn project (which is an impressive&nbsp;structure, which once complete in 2009 will generate enough&nbsp;electricity for about 120 million people) to freezing cold&nbsp;weather and a quickly setting sun - at which point we climbed&nbsp;aboard the Chinese cruise ship that intrepid had arranged.. this&nbsp;is the kinda ship you might take your mistress away to if you&nbsp;wanted a "dirty" weekend in China..&nbsp; It's a tub made of very&nbsp;rusty plate steel, 3 decks, water that was generally always near&nbsp;freezing, spittoons in all the hallways that defy description and&nbsp;in my "first class" cabin I shared with a fellow traveller there&nbsp;was stained sheets and the most foul smell... it was pretty funny&nbsp;:P - I was really greatfull to have brought my own sheet and&nbsp;pillowcase!</p>
<p>So we set off, and went through a couple of locks in the dark -&nbsp;only about 30 odd metres each.. the boat is chaotic, as it's not&nbsp;designed for western tourists but the Chinese tourists.&nbsp; All&nbsp;well 'n good, the temperature seemed to keep dropping all night.</p>
<p>So we wake on the second day to see snow falling all over the&nbsp;first of the 3 gorges - the scenery is breath taking, apparently&nbsp;this is the first time anyone has seen it snow here - so it felt&nbsp;pretty special (though bloody cold, I've never heard Desmond (the&nbsp;english guy I share a room with) say "Jesus Wept!" so many&nbsp;times... very funny.. I hope the pictures I took convey just how&nbsp;amazing it looked.</p>
<p>The proposed height marks for the water (about 175 metres above&nbsp;sea level) on the hillsides everywhere just makes you realise how&nbsp;much housing and farm land will&nbsp;disappear&nbsp;when the project comes&nbsp;on line - nothing in China is a on a small scale (accept for&nbsp;farming, but that must eventually change with the shift of the&nbsp;population towards the cities) and this project is a wonderful&nbsp;example of the chinese people exerting there will against nature&nbsp;(the projects main motivation is to stop the devastating 10 year&nbsp;floods which cost billions in damages in lost lives).&nbsp;They're all very proud.</p>
<p>We ended getting on the turps and having a bit of a card playing&nbsp;and drinking sessions that night, and I had my first experience&nbsp;with Chinese spirits... god almighty they're awful, the one I had&nbsp;was "like" vodka, but made from sorgam and around 45% alcohol..&nbsp;when drunken with "future cola" the coke equivalent in china,&nbsp;that's miles cheaper, it was a&nbsp;lethal&nbsp;combination...</p>
<p>And so I awoke today feel surprisingly good for all my drinking,&nbsp;the boat steemed back down the gorges and we've arrived back on&nbsp;land - tonight we're staying put then early tomorrow we begin to&nbsp;move towards the coast again, with the destination (eventually)&nbsp;being shanghai... it should be all fun, though I'm feeling pretty&nbsp;whacked.</p>
