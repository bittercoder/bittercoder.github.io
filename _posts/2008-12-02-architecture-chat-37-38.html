<p>Apologies for not having written up the last couple of Architecture<br />
chats - because I'm short for time I'm just going to publish some<br />
links for the various things we talked about in both chats.<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
Code Analysis Toolks (Chat #38)<br &#47;></p>
<ul>
<li>
    <a href="http:&#47;&#47;wesnerm.blogs.com&#47;net_undocumented&#47;nstatic&#47;">NStatic<&#47;a><br />

    Analysis tool and some it's history.<br />
  <&#47;li></p>
<li>The demise of <a href="http:&#47;&#47;msdn.microsoft.com&#47;en-us&#47;library&#47;bb429476.aspx">FxCop<&#47;a><br />
  and some discussion about why it doesn't seem to be up to play<br />
  with the 3.5 Framework and also some discussion around it's<br />
  Integration with VS.Net.<br />
  <&#47;li></p>
<li>
    <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.mono-project.com&#47;Gendarme">Gendarme<&#47;a><br />
    from the Mono Project.<br />
  <&#47;li></p>
<li>
    <a href="http:&#47;&#47;code.google.com&#47;p&#47;smokey&#47;">Smokey<&#47;a> - which I<br />

  <&#47;li></p>
<li>VS2010 Code Analysis &amp; Code Metrics support.<br />
  <&#47;li></p>
<li>
    <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.ndepend.com&#47;">NDepend<&#47;a> and the challenge<br />
    of interpreting results.<br />
  <&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul>Domain driven design examples (Chat #38) - we had a brief<br />
lunchtime discussion around what's out there and the difficulties<br />
in finding more holistic examples - the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;dddsample.sourceforge.net&#47;download.html">Shipping<br />
sample<&#47;a> is a good resource, but is for Java - there was a<br />
proposal a while back on the ALT.Net list to port this over to .Net<br />
&amp; NHibernate (with a first cut of the domain model done with<br />
<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.nakedobjects.net&#47;home&#47;index.shtmlhttp:&#47;&#47;www.nakedobjects.net&#47;home&#47;index.shtmlhttp:&#47;&#47;www.nakedobjects.net&#47;home&#47;index.shtmlhttp:&#47;&#47;www.nakedobjects.net&#47;home&#47;index.shtmlhttp:&#47;&#47;www.nakedobjects.net&#47;home&#47;index.shtmlhttp:&#47;&#47;www.nakedobjects.net&#47;home&#47;index.shtml"><br />
Naked Objects<&#47;a>) but haven't heard much since.<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
Discussed that Microsoft etc. are still searching for more <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.microsoft.com&#47;nz&#47;imaginecup09&#47;nzmentors.aspx">industry<br />
mentors<&#47;a> in Auckland to participate in the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;imaginecup.com&#47;">Imagine Cup<&#47;a> 2009 - incidentally this<br />
year the topic is a lot more forgiving (it came under some critcism<br />
last year with it's environmental focus).<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
Other topics for Chat #38 Also include BizSpark, and the good parts<br />
(great from a cashflow perspective) and bad parts (generally forces<br />
you into a forming a seperate company if you've already been<br />
established for a while or making the move from bespoke to product)<br />
- we also had a discussion&#47;report of the Microsoft Focus group that<br />
Garreth &amp; myself attended.&nbsp;<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
Also discussed was the OODB -> ORM Idea and the issues around<br />
the performance profile issues you may only discover once you swap<br />
to an ORM i.e. SELECT N + 1 etc, as a brief talk about the<br />
implications of writing LOB applications in Silverlight, hosted<br />
within a winforms app.&nbsp; I argued against the OODB because most<br />
of the benefits can be realised as long as your ORM is capable of<br />
generating a schema, such as NHibernate and many others can.<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
Chat #37 Covered a lot of PDC details, Windows 7, MS Surface SDK<br />
availability, NHibernate profiler, Mozilla Prism, Linq to Sql being<br />
put on the back-burner, C# 4 features, The M grammar language and<br />
some discussion around things we're not entirely clear on yet i.e.<br />
how does M handle migrations and scheme changes as the<br />
understanding of a domain&#47;model evolves.&nbsp; There was a lot more<br />
besides that, but my memory fails me.<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
The next chat is this Thursday 4th December - it may or may not be<br />
the last one for the year - we shall see!<br &#47;></p>
