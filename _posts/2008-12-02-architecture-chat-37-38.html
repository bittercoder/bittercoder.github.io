<p>Apologies for not having written up the last couple of Architecture<br>
chats - because I'm short for time I'm just going to publish some<br>
links for the various things we talked about in both chats.<br><br>
<br><br>
Code Analysis Toolks (Chat #38)<br></p>
<ul>
<li>
    <a href="http://wesnerm.blogs.com/net_undocumented/nstatic/">NStatic</a><br>
    - and some of the other stuff <a href="http://wesnerm.blogs.com/">Wesne</a><a href="http://wesnerm.blogs.com/">r Moise</a> gets up to.<br>
  </li>
<li>
    <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms933794.aspx">PREfast</a><br>
    Analysis tool and some it's history.<br>
  </li>
<li>The demise of <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb429476.aspx">FxCop</a><br>
  and some discussion about why it doesn't seem to be up to play<br>
  with the 3.5 Framework and also some discussion around it's<br>
  Integration with VS.Net.<br>
  </li>
<li>
    <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Gendarme">Gendarme</a><br>
    from the Mono Project.<br>
  </li>
<li>
    <a href="http://code.google.com/p/smokey/">Smokey</a> - which I<br>
    think is integrated into mono develop now along with Gendarme.<br>
  </li>
<li>VS2010 Code Analysis &amp; Code Metrics support.<br>
  </li>
<li>
    <a href="http://www.ndepend.com/">NDepend</a> and the challenge<br>
    of interpreting results.<br>
  </li><br>
</ul>Domain driven design examples (Chat #38) - we had a brief<br>
lunchtime discussion around what's out there and the difficulties<br>
in finding more holistic examples - the <a href="http://dddsample.sourceforge.net/download.html">Shipping<br>
sample</a> is a good resource, but is for Java - there was a<br>
proposal a while back on the ALT.Net list to port this over to .Net<br>
&amp; NHibernate (with a first cut of the domain model done with<br>
<a href="http://www.nakedobjects.net/home/index.shtmlhttp://www.nakedobjects.net/home/index.shtmlhttp://www.nakedobjects.net/home/index.shtmlhttp://www.nakedobjects.net/home/index.shtmlhttp://www.nakedobjects.net/home/index.shtmlhttp://www.nakedobjects.net/home/index.shtml"><br>
Naked Objects</a>) but haven't heard much since.<br><br>
<br><br>
Discussed that Microsoft etc. are still searching for more <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/nz/imaginecup09/nzmentors.aspx">industry<br>
mentors</a> in Auckland to participate in the <a href="http://imaginecup.com/">Imagine Cup</a> 2009 - incidentally this<br>
year the topic is a lot more forgiving (it came under some critcism<br>
last year with it's environmental focus).<br><br>
<br><br>
Other topics for Chat #38 Also include BizSpark, and the good parts<br>
(great from a cashflow perspective) and bad parts (generally forces<br>
you into a forming a seperate company if you've already been<br>
established for a while or making the move from bespoke to product)<br>
- we also had a discussion/report of the Microsoft Focus group that<br>
Garreth &amp; myself attended.&nbsp;<br><br>
<br><br>
Also discussed was the OODB -> ORM Idea and the issues around<br>
the performance profile issues you may only discover once you swap<br>
to an ORM i.e. SELECT N + 1 etc, as a brief talk about the<br>
implications of writing LOB applications in Silverlight, hosted<br>
within a winforms app.&nbsp; I argued against the OODB because most<br>
of the benefits can be realised as long as your ORM is capable of<br>
generating a schema, such as NHibernate and many others can.<br><br>
<br><br>
Chat #37 Covered a lot of PDC details, Windows 7, MS Surface SDK<br>
availability, NHibernate profiler, Mozilla Prism, Linq to Sql being<br>
put on the back-burner, C# 4 features, The M grammar language and<br>
some discussion around things we're not entirely clear on yet i.e.<br>
how does M handle migrations and scheme changes as the<br>
understanding of a domain/model evolves.&nbsp; There was a lot more<br>
besides that, but my memory fails me.<br><br>
<br><br>
The next chat is this Thursday 4th December - it may or may not be<br>
the last one for the year - we shall see!<br>
