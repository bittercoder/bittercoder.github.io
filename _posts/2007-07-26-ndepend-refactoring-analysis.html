<p>About to run off to a meeting... so I'll make this quick.</p>
<p>Just read an interesting post by <a href="http://igloocoder.com/default.aspx">Donald Belcham</a> on&nbsp;Refactoring Analysis with the help of nDepend... he's gone through&nbsp;the process of moving from .Net 1.1 to 2.0, then introducing&nbsp;interface based code, breaking classes apart to ensure they're&nbsp;enforcing the principle of single responsibility, moving to&nbsp;injecting dependencies, rolling his own primitive Inversion of&nbsp;Control container and finally employing the <a href="http://www.castleproject.org/">Castle Project's</a> <a href="http://wiki.bittercoder.com/ContainerTutorials.ashx">windsor&nbsp;container</a> instead.</p>
<p>It pays to know a little bit about <a href="http://www.ndepend.com/">nDepend</a> of course to understand the&nbsp;Abstractness vs Relational Cohesion figures... either take a look&nbsp;at the nDepend site, or maybe have a listen to the &nbsp;<a href="http://www.intellectualhedonism.com/2007/02/15/Hanselminutes51StaticCodeAnalysisWithNDepend.aspx">.Net Rocks podcast</a> earlier this year which covered the same&nbsp;topic.</p>
<p>I'm not sure the figures actually answer questions so much as they&nbsp;ask them ... but it's interesting to see how much impact his first&nbsp;two rounds of refactoring had on the results.</p>
<p>I wonder how the figures would've come out had he executed his&nbsp;refactoring in a different order...&nbsp; maybe DI first, then&nbsp;breaking the classes up based on responsibility, IoC and then&nbsp;finally introducing interfaces... hmmm</p>
