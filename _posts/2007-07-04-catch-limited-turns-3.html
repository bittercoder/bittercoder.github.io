  So <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.catch.net.nz&#47;">Catch Ltd<&#47;a> (one of<br />
  <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.devdefined.com&#47;">DevDefined's<&#47;a> partners)<br />
  turned 3 today, and there was a few birthday celebrations&nbsp;<br />
  this evening.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only was it an opportunity for me to<br />
  establish my supremacy in the role of worst ten pin bowler, but<br />
  it was I think one of the first times the entire Catch team<br />
  actually got to the meet each other - considering the&nbsp;type<br />
  of work Catch does (providing QA, BA &amp; PM resources<br />
  primarily,&nbsp;generally on-site) it's actually pretty rare for<br />
  everyone to be in one place at the same time!<br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>
  It's been great to watch a company that started off effectively<br />
  with just the Managing Director Bryce Day&nbsp;3 years ago reach<br />
  a size where you can't even fit all the employees into&nbsp;a<br />
  meeting room any more, with new roles being created on an<br />
  almost&nbsp;weekly basis, exciting times ahead for Catch I would<br />
  say!<br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>
  Great work Bryce, and all the Catch Staff - keep up the great<br />
  work!<br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>
  And for anyone looking for a company which can provide highly<br />
  skilled and talented PM, BA or QA resources or end-to-end<br />
  software development leveraging the skill sets in both Catch<br />
  Limited and DevDefined then why not drop Catch <a href="mailto:info@catch.net.nz">an email<&#47;a>?<br />
<&#47;p></p>
