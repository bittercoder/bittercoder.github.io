<p>Apologies for the late posting, there is in fact an Architecture&nbsp;Chat tomorrow, at the usual time of 11:30am @ Garrisons, Sylvia&nbsp;Park (Thursday 26th March 2009).</p>
<p>Some topics that have interested me lately which we might want to&nbsp;discuss:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some M debates going on - Ayende has a interesting post&nbsp;"<a href="http://ayende.com/Blog/archive/2009/03/23/m-is-to-dsl-as-drag-amp-drop-is-to.aspx">M&nbsp;is to DSL as Drag &amp; Drop is to programming</a>" and there's&nbsp;also James Clark has an interesting post on <a href="http://blog.jclark.com/2009/03/getting-involved-with-m.html">Getting&nbsp;involved with M</a>.&nbsp; If nothing else It doesn't seem like&nbsp;the entire M story has revealed itself yet (but where have we&nbsp;heard that line before?) and we're plagued with examples that&nbsp;aren't really solving business problems or demonstrating&nbsp;technical beyond what I could achieve with boo or ANTLR.</li>
<li>There's a couple of M DSL's that appeared last week -&nbsp;<a href="http://www.douglaspurdy.com/2009/03/20/murl-a-dsl-for-restful-clients/">MUrl</a>, a DSL for restful clients and <a href="http://www.douglaspurdy.com/2009/03/20/mservice-a-dsl-for-restful-services/">MService</a> - not great examples in my opinion, but&nbsp;interesting none the less.</li>
<li><a href="http://azure.snagy.name/blog/?p=89">Azure Fabric&nbsp;Controller</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.jimmy.schementi.com/2009/03/ironruby-03-released.html">IronRuby 0.3 Released</a>.</li>
<li>ASP.Net MVC 1.0 release - has <a href="http://ianfnelson.com/blog/asp-net-just-became-a-legacy-platform/">asp.net webforms just become a legacy platform?</a></li>
<li><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/alexj/archive/2009/03/24/self-tracking-entities.aspx">Self Tracking Entities in Entity Framework</a>.</li>
<li>Fluent interfaces - are they potentially doing more harm then&nbsp;good, is there a well understood sweet spot between&nbsp;discoverability and efficiency / being concise. What do we think&nbsp;of things like the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/nunitex/">NUnitEx</a> project?</li><br>
</ul><br>
Also we only had 3 people including myself turn up last time, a&nbsp;new low (a <a href="http://www.conchords.co.nz/">flight of the<br>
conchords</a> band meeting basically ;o) - but one of the&nbsp;participants had driven all the way from Hamilton just to attend,&nbsp;so well done there!
<p>..which also means I'll be recycling many of the previous topics&nbsp;we didn't cover last week as well:</p>
<ul>
<li>Relational data features <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ssds/default.aspx">to come to Azure</a>&nbsp;(via TDS no less, so nhibernate/lightspeed/EF etc. on Azure are a&nbsp;reality) and REST to go away. My first thought is will it scale,&nbsp;or do we still need to fall back to an EAV approach when dealing&nbsp;with huge datasets?</li>
<li>T4 <a href="http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2009/Mar-10.html">Support in&nbsp;Mono</a>. I'd also be interested in talking about who's using T4&nbsp;and for what.</li>
<li>Moq 3.0 <a href="http://www.clariusconsulting.net/blogs/kzu/archive/2009/03/05/120009.aspx">has gone RTM</a>.</li>
<li>DevHawk has an interesting series of articles on <a href="http://devhawk.net/CategoryView,category,Debugger.aspx">writing&nbsp;an IronPython debugger</a>.</li>
<li>Ivan Porto Carrero is making <a href="http://flanders.co.nz/2009/03/09/ironruby-mvc-progress/">good&nbsp;progress</a> on his IronRuby MVC implementation.</li>
<li>Gem/package/dependency management tools for .Net emerging and&nbsp;existing/dead - <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ngems/">ngems</a>, <a href="http://github.com/scottcreynolds/rocks/tree/master">rocks</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://code.google.com/p/scotaltdotnet/">horn</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.codeplex.com/nmaven">nmaven</a>, <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/npanday">NPanday</a>, <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/byldan">Byldan</a> or even just using&nbsp;<a href="http://www.rubygems.org/">ruby gems</a> itself... &nbsp;What's going on in this space, how it might improve .Net adoption&nbsp;(and some of the thoughts people have blogged about the subject&nbsp;after the alt.net conf).</li>
<li>Casey Charlton is starting to blog about a <a href="http://devlicio.us/blogs/casey/archive/2009/03/09/ddd-sample-application-first-steps.aspx">sample DDD application</a>, the DDD Parcel Service, which&nbsp;should be an interesting exercise to follow.</li>
<li>Dr Dobb's Journal (DDJ) <a href="http://davidgardiner.blogspot.com/2009/03/dr-dobbs-journal-1976-2009.html">is dead</a> - though I haven't bought an issue in a few years,&nbsp;and really they were too expensive in NZ currency terms for&nbsp;what little you got, it seems a little sad... are there any&nbsp;print magazines left for the developer?</li>
<li>Roy Osherove is surveying to see what <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/rosherove/archive/2009/03/09/what-isolation-mocking-and-unit-testing-framework-are-you-using.aspx">unit testing / mocking frameworks</a> people are using -&nbsp;hopefully this will get enough responses to be somewhat<br>
balanced.</li>
<li>Recent Alt.net Conference in Seattle ... what went on, some&nbsp;interesting thoughts from people like <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ExperiencingALTNETSeattle2009OpenSpaces.aspx">Scott Hanselman</a>, <a href="http://ayende.com/Blog/archive/2009/03/04/alt.net-alienation-by-adoption.aspx">Ayende</a>, <a href="http://codeclimber.net.nz/archive/2009/02/28/the-alt.net-conference-loving-it.aspx">Simone</a> and an interview on the <a href="http://www.altnetpodcast.com/episodes/17-the-state-of-alt-net">alt.net podcast with Scott Bellware</a>.</li><br>
</ul><br>
We'll be meeting at the usual time of 11:30am @ Garrisons, Sylvia&nbsp;Park, Tomorrow (Thursday 26th March 2009) - and the topics above&nbsp;are just there in case we run out of anything else to talk about&nbsp;(which is rare).
<p>For more details on the location and write-ups of previous&nbsp;sessions you can consult the associated <a href="http://wiki.bittercoder.com/SylviaParkArchitectureChats.ashx">wiki</a>.</p>
