<p>Apologies for the late posting, there is in fact an Architecture&nbsp;Chat tomorrow, at the usual time of 11:30am @ Garrisons, Sylvia&nbsp;Park (Thursday 26th March 2009).</p>
<p>Some topics that have interested me lately which we might want to&nbsp;discuss:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some M debates going on - Ayende has a interesting post&nbsp;"<a href="http:&#47;&#47;ayende.com&#47;Blog&#47;archive&#47;2009&#47;03&#47;23&#47;m-is-to-dsl-as-drag-amp-drop-is-to.aspx">M&nbsp;is to DSL as Drag &amp; Drop is to programming<&#47;a>" and there's&nbsp;also James Clark has an interesting post on <a href="http:&#47;&#47;blog.jclark.com&#47;2009&#47;03&#47;getting-involved-with-m.html">Getting&nbsp;involved with M<&#47;a>.&nbsp; If nothing else It doesn't seem like&nbsp;the entire M story has revealed itself yet (but where have we&nbsp;heard that line before?) and we're plagued with examples that&nbsp;aren't really solving business problems or demonstrating&nbsp;technical beyond what I could achieve with boo or ANTLR.<&#47;li>
<li>There's a couple of M DSL's that appeared last week -&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.douglaspurdy.com&#47;2009&#47;03&#47;20&#47;murl-a-dsl-for-restful-clients&#47;">MUrl<&#47;a>, a DSL for restful clients and <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.douglaspurdy.com&#47;2009&#47;03&#47;20&#47;mservice-a-dsl-for-restful-services&#47;">MService<&#47;a> - not great examples in my opinion, but&nbsp;interesting none the less.<&#47;li>
<li><a href="http:&#47;&#47;azure.snagy.name&#47;blog&#47;?p=89">Azure Fabric&nbsp;Controller<&#47;a>.<&#47;li>
<li><a href="http:&#47;&#47;blog.jimmy.schementi.com&#47;2009&#47;03&#47;ironruby-03-released.html">IronRuby 0.3 Released<&#47;a>.<&#47;li>
<li>ASP.Net MVC 1.0 release - has <a href="http:&#47;&#47;ianfnelson.com&#47;blog&#47;asp-net-just-became-a-legacy-platform&#47;">asp.net webforms just become a legacy platform?<&#47;a><&#47;li>
<li><a href="http:&#47;&#47;blogs.msdn.com&#47;alexj&#47;archive&#47;2009&#47;03&#47;24&#47;self-tracking-entities.aspx">Self Tracking Entities in Entity Framework<&#47;a>.<&#47;li>
<li>Fluent interfaces - are they potentially doing more harm then&nbsp;good, is there a well understood sweet spot between&nbsp;discoverability and efficiency &#47; being concise. What do we think&nbsp;of things like the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;code.google.com&#47;p&#47;nunitex&#47;">NUnitEx<&#47;a> project?<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
Also we only had 3 people including myself turn up last time, a&nbsp;new low (a <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.conchords.co.nz&#47;">flight of the<br />
conchords<&#47;a> band meeting basically ;o) - but one of the&nbsp;participants had driven all the way from Hamilton just to attend,&nbsp;so well done there!</p>
<p>..which also means I'll be recycling many of the previous topics&nbsp;we didn't cover last week as well:</p>
<ul>
<li>Relational data features <a href="http:&#47;&#47;blogs.msdn.com&#47;ssds&#47;default.aspx">to come to Azure<&#47;a>&nbsp;(via TDS no less, so nhibernate&#47;lightspeed&#47;EF etc. on Azure are a&nbsp;reality) and REST to go away. My first thought is will it scale,&nbsp;or do we still need to fall back to an EAV approach when dealing&nbsp;with huge datasets?<&#47;li>
<li>T4 <a href="http:&#47;&#47;tirania.org&#47;blog&#47;archive&#47;2009&#47;Mar-10.html">Support in&nbsp;Mono<&#47;a>. I'd also be interested in talking about who's using T4&nbsp;and for what.<&#47;li>
<li>Moq 3.0 <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.clariusconsulting.net&#47;blogs&#47;kzu&#47;archive&#47;2009&#47;03&#47;05&#47;120009.aspx">has gone RTM<&#47;a>.<&#47;li>
<li>DevHawk has an interesting series of articles on <a href="http:&#47;&#47;devhawk.net&#47;CategoryView,category,Debugger.aspx">writing&nbsp;an IronPython debugger<&#47;a>.<&#47;li>
<li>Ivan Porto Carrero is making <a href="http:&#47;&#47;flanders.co.nz&#47;2009&#47;03&#47;09&#47;ironruby-mvc-progress&#47;">good&nbsp;progress<&#47;a> on his IronRuby MVC implementation.<&#47;li>
<li>Gem&#47;package&#47;dependency management tools for .Net emerging and&nbsp;existing&#47;dead - <a href="http:&#47;&#47;code.google.com&#47;p&#47;ngems&#47;">ngems<&#47;a>, <a href="http:&#47;&#47;github.com&#47;scottcreynolds&#47;rocks&#47;tree&#47;master">rocks<&#47;a>,&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;code.google.com&#47;p&#47;scotaltdotnet&#47;">horn<&#47;a>,&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.codeplex.com&#47;nmaven">nmaven<&#47;a>, <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.codeplex.com&#47;npanday">NPanday<&#47;a>, <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.codeplex.com&#47;byldan">Byldan<&#47;a> or even just using&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.rubygems.org&#47;">ruby gems<&#47;a> itself... &nbsp;What's going on in this space, how it might improve .Net adoption&nbsp;(and some of the thoughts people have blogged about the subject&nbsp;after the alt.net conf).<&#47;li>
<li>Casey Charlton is starting to blog about a <a href="http:&#47;&#47;devlicio.us&#47;blogs&#47;casey&#47;archive&#47;2009&#47;03&#47;09&#47;ddd-sample-application-first-steps.aspx">sample DDD application<&#47;a>, the DDD Parcel Service, which&nbsp;should be an interesting exercise to follow.<&#47;li>
<li>Dr Dobb's Journal (DDJ) <a href="http:&#47;&#47;davidgardiner.blogspot.com&#47;2009&#47;03&#47;dr-dobbs-journal-1976-2009.html">is dead<&#47;a> - though I haven't bought an issue in a few years,&nbsp;and really they were too expensive in NZ currency terms for&nbsp;what little you got, it seems a little sad... are there any&nbsp;print magazines left for the developer?<&#47;li>
<li>Roy Osherove is surveying to see what <a href="http:&#47;&#47;weblogs.asp.net&#47;rosherove&#47;archive&#47;2009&#47;03&#47;09&#47;what-isolation-mocking-and-unit-testing-framework-are-you-using.aspx">unit testing &#47; mocking frameworks<&#47;a> people are using -&nbsp;hopefully this will get enough responses to be somewhat<br />
balanced.<&#47;li></p>
<li>Recent Alt.net Conference in Seattle ... what went on, some&nbsp;interesting thoughts from people like <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.hanselman.com&#47;blog&#47;ExperiencingALTNETSeattle2009OpenSpaces.aspx">Scott Hanselman<&#47;a>, <a href="http:&#47;&#47;ayende.com&#47;Blog&#47;archive&#47;2009&#47;03&#47;04&#47;alt.net-alienation-by-adoption.aspx">Ayende<&#47;a>, <a href="http:&#47;&#47;codeclimber.net.nz&#47;archive&#47;2009&#47;02&#47;28&#47;the-alt.net-conference-loving-it.aspx">Simone<&#47;a> and an interview on the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.altnetpodcast.com&#47;episodes&#47;17-the-state-of-alt-net">alt.net podcast with Scott Bellware<&#47;a>.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
We'll be meeting at the usual time of 11:30am @ Garrisons, Sylvia&nbsp;Park, Tomorrow (Thursday 26th March 2009) - and the topics above&nbsp;are just there in case we run out of anything else to talk about&nbsp;(which is rare).</p>
