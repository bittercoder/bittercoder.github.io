    your family through that too many times!\r\n\r\nBe great if you can let your kiwi

<p>Catch Software, where I lead development on Enterprise Tester (among other products) are expanding the development team.</p>
<p>We are looking to add a full-time (Salary) software developer to work on product development.</p>
<p><b>If you are:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Pragmatic.</li>
<li>Passionate.</li>
<li>Based in Auckland, New Zealand.</li>
<li>Care about your craft.</li><br>
</ul>
<p><b>And have a keen interest in:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Shipping! <span style="color: #D9416C">Often!</span></li>
<li>Directly influencing the design inside and out of software being delivered.</li>
<li>Building extensible software.</li><br>
</ul>
<p>Then we want to talk to you.</p>
<p>Enterprise Tester is a web application primarily written in C# and JavaScript (and a bit of F#), so those skills will be essential for you to fit well into the roll.  The codebase is very JavaScript heavy so candidates with exceptional JavaScript development skills, with less experience in C# (or just a waning interest) would also be a great fit.</p>
<p>Beyond that the ideal addition to our team will need to be somebody who:</p>
<ul>
<li>Has a sense of humour.</li>
<li>Proven track record.</li>
<li>Does not drink too deeply of the Microsoft cool-aid.</li>
<li>Interested in the challenges of building a platform (API's, plugins, server-side and client-side extension points etc.)</li>
<li>Enjoys constantly learning.</li>
<li>Has great spoken and written communication skills.</li><br>
</ul>
<p>We are a close-knit group at Catch Software, and have a great team - so we are going to be a little picky about who we add to it, be fore-warned - but to counter this, for the developer we decide to add to the team, this is also a well remunerated position acknowledging the skills you can bring to our team ($150K+).</p>
<p>P.S. If I talked to you about working at catch software over the last year, and you&rsquo;re looking for a change of scene in 2013, Drop me a line and we can catch up for a coffee/talk.</p>
