<h2>Background</h2><br><br>
As a bit of background, for the last couple of months I've been doing some work for a personal client aside from the work for<br>
<a href="http://www.syzmk.com/">Seismic Technologies</a> which is on the back burner till we pick up some more investment interest (I'm still the lead dev though) - the project is an add-in for an existing product (COM interop) which be must be deeply-integrated, as well as being capable of being used in stand alone mode...<br><br>
<br><br>
It's a very advantageous project considering the time frame, but that's part of the fun :) Once the clients moved forward on some marketing I'll post a little more about some of the challenges I've faced along the way.<br><br>
<br><br>
At any rate - the project's stalled briefly while the clients doing a little business analysis to get the underlying methodology sorted - so they've asked me to switch across to building the license generation / customer portal / license purchasing module for their preexisting CMS system (<a href="http://www.cmsmadesimple.org/">CMS made simple - PHP</a>) ... where are the ruby or Monorail CMS's to wean my clients onto?<br>
<h2>  PHP... ack</h2>... So I haven't used PHP in anger for years and years, but the one advantage of dynamic languages is you can generally hit the ground running a lot quicker then their statically compiled competitors...&nbsp; maybe PHP even more so because it's focused on web development.<br><br>
<br><br>
So far the two things that have bugged/puzzled me are:<br>
<ul>
<li>Classes don't call their base classes default constructor implicity - you have to do that yourself.&nbsp; This isn't all  bad, at least you can control when the default constructor is called.<br><br>
  </li>
<li>Methods are instance, static and pseudo-instance all in one...<br><br>
  </li><br>
</ul>I think the second one bugs me more because you end up with 2+ potential code paths that should be accounted for in testing, if your exposing an "api" for consumption - or more importantly you should throw an exception for the usages you don't wish to allow (I'm probably missing the "quick and dirty" point here of course ;o) - it's hard to fight years of&nbsp; <b>instance methods != static methods</b>...<br><br>
<br><br>
Maybe I'm just old fashioned and there's nothing wrong with this, I should have a flick through <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-Pragmatics-Second-Michael/dp/0126339511"> Programming Language Pragmatics</a> again, there must be some other dynamic languages with similar behavior?<br><br>
<br><br>
At any rate, the example:<br><br>
<br>
<pre>
<p>class A<br>
{<br>
   function foo()<br>
   {<br>
       if (isset($this)) {<br>
           echo '$this is defined (';<br>
           echo get_class($this);<br>
           echo ")n";<br>
       } else {<br>
           echo "$this is not defined.n";<br>
       }<br>
   }<br>
}</p>
<p>class B<br>
{<br>
   function bar()<br>
   {<br>
       A::foo();<br>
   }<br>
}</p>
<p>$a = new A();<br>
$a->foo();<br>
A::foo();<br>
$b = new B();<br>
$b->bar();<br>
B::bar();</p>
<p></p></pre>
<p><br><br>
And the output of that little example is shown below, notice how <b>A:foo()</b> knew it was being called from <b>class<br>
B</b>...&nbsp; I wonder what <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/Phalanger">phalanger</a> is doing under the hood to achieve the same thing in the CLR...<br><br>
<br></p>
<pre>
<p>$this is defined (a)<br>
$this is not defined.<br>
$this is defined (b)<br>
$this is not defined.</p>
<p></p></pre>
