    Hi Tim,

    The scrollbar example seems stupid to me... there are other mechanisms in most UI frameworks for achieving the same thing...

    Well let's see... in the past I've done things such as:

     * Implementing caching over a simple store (so methods that write store a copy in cache, and methods that read check the cache first to see if the results have been fetched in the past.  At that point it's very easy to enabled/disable caching, and there is a good separation of concerns.
     * Implementing validation of parameters for a preexisting class, so you create a decorator which validates arguments, then proceeds to call the underlying implementation if everything is OK (or throws an exception if not).
     * Synchronization mechanisms (decorate a store, when somebody saves something, the decorator intercepts, and generally raises an event which the UI can respond to - say to keep a tree view in sync... quite elegant when working with a WCF service).
     * Implementing an additional interface on a preexisting class, technically that could be considered another kind of pattern though.

    Decorators are a good fit with IoC - be sure to have a look at my IoC tutorials:

<p>More parts in the container tutorial series are on the way, I've<br />
just been a little busy these last few days.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
However I had a discussion with someone about decorators this week<br />
- they eluded to them being too hard to "create" and maintain, and<br />
that opportunities to get them wrong abound (manually writing the<br />
code to call all the members of the inner service) - I was a little<br />
astounded that they didn't know how to do this using<br />
ReSharper.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
So heres a quick 1 minute tutorial for those that don't know, first<br />
an interface.<br /><br />
<br /></p>
<pre>
public interface IBondService<br />
{<br />
    void Smoke50Cigarettes();<br />
    void RegisterEnemy(string name);<br />
    void GetOfBed();<br />
    bool GunLoaded();<br />
}<br />
</pre><br /><br />
Now let's write the start of our decorator.<br /><br />
<br /></p>
<pre>
public class BondService : IBondService<br />
{<br />
    private readonly IBondService _innerService;</p>
<p>    public BondService(IBondService innerService)<br />
    {<br />
        _innerService = innerService;<br />
    }<br />
}<br />
</pre><br /><br />
And then generate the rest... by going to: <b>ReSharper<br />
->Code->Generate...->Delegating Members<br /><br />
<br /></b>Or just type <b>Alt-insert</b> (if your using the default<br />
key bindings) and select "Delegating Members".<br /><br />
<br /><br />
At that point select the only option, the inner service.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<img src="http://blog.bittercoder.com/images/delegate_members_1.png" altsrc="delegate_members_1.png" border="0" height="245" widthsrc="400" /><br /><br />
<br /><br />
And then select all the members to delegate for.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<img src="http://blog.bittercoder.com/images/delegate_members_2.png" altsrc="delegate_members_2.png" border="0" height="276" widthsrc="400" /><br /><br />
<br /><br />
And then we get the results... joy<br /><br />
<br /></p>
<pre>
public class BondService : IBondService<br />
{<br />
    private readonly IBondService _innerService;</p>
<p>    public BondService(IBondService innerService)<br />
    {<br />
        _innerService = innerService;<br />
    }</p>
<p>    public void Smoke50Cigarettes()<br />
    {<br />
        _innerService.Smoke50Cigarettes();<br />
    }</p>
<p>    public void RegisterEnemy(string name)<br />
    {<br />
        _innerService.RegisterEnemy(name);<br />
    }</p>
<p>    public void GetOfBed()<br />
    {<br />
        _innerService.GetOfBed();<br />
    }</p>
<p>    public bool GunLoaded()<br />
    {<br />
        return _innerService.GunLoaded();<br />
    }<br />
}<br />
</pre><br /></p>
