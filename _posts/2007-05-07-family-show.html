<p>So I quite like <a href="http://www.vertigo.com/familyshow.aspx">Family.Show</a> as an end to end solution of WPF goes... but I think what's been more fascinating is seeing how my (beautiful) Financee is finding it as a working product.</p>
<p>So she's a big genealogy zealot - and for the first time when saying "hey have a look at this" for some random piece of tech I could see here interest was piqued, so we click-once'd it onto her machine and she's been playing around with it for the last day or so - having loaded around 300 people into it so far.</p>
<p>First off the <strong>good</strong> - it's pretty, and very fluent - you can see immediately who's being edited, current vs. past relationships, dead vs. alive (hollow people are dead... ) And it performs nicely... 200+ vector "people" on screen and the machines not sweating a bit.</p>
<p>Surprisingly it's also pretty quick for data entry, something I had my doubts about when first looking at the application vs. something a little more traditional - after about 5 minutes of experimentation she was an expert.</p>
<p>Second the <strong>bugs</strong>... well the main one is that certain characters in a name like a double quote causes the "stories" data screen to crash upon saving...&nbsp; And every now and then it just flakes out completely... I might throw some logging into and see just what's going on, it doesn't even let you get a stack trace *erk*.</p>
<p>Interaction - well here's where she's getting pissed with it and I'll probably need to enhance it a little - and it's all to do with relationships...&nbsp; there doesn't appear to be any way to establish a relationship between two people once their added to the tree... a pretty big oversight - they expect you to add all relationships by adding a brother/mother/father/sister/spouse/child to the person currently being edited, but that means you cant actually implement something like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Joe marries Jane</li>
<li>Bob marries Martha</li>
<li>Jane &amp; Bob die</li>
<li>Joe marries Martha</li><br />
</ul><br />
A big problem during times of war because it was not uncommon for widows to marry the brother of their dead husband.&nbsp; This seems like a big oversight (though it is just a tech demo).</p>
<p>Interesting though, and this sample is definitely the best WPF app with source code I've had to play/learn from... great stuff <a href="http://www.vertigo.com/">Vertigo</a>.</p>
