<h2>Introduction</h2></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>APIs are exciting. Not because of their tech per se but because they unlock the ability to innovate. It's all about enablement..</p>&mdash; Ben Kepes (@benkepes) <a href="https://twitter.com/benkepes/status/236615926265544704" data-datetime="2012-08-18T00:10:07+00:00">August 18, 2012</a></blockquote><br />
<script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>As I mentioned in my last post, part of the development for the latest version of Enterprise Tester has included a greatly expanded REST API.</p>
<p>This REST API is implemented using <a href="http://www.asp.net/web-api">ASP.Net WebAPI</a>.</p>
<p>The technology Behind the API is not necessarily "exciting" (compared to what the API enables for customers and 3rd party developers) - but demonstrates taking a large and complex application and exposing much of the functionality through the API.</p>
<p>There are plenty of examples of WebAPI usage out there on blogs, but not much information from people implementing larger API's end-to-end, or retro-fitting an API to an existing (brown-fields) application.  </p>
<p>So I thought this was a good opportunity to dive a little deeper into the implementation of the API. </p>
<p>I'm going to break this up into a few posts covering the various aspects of the API implementation:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="/?p=83489868">Links, absolute URI's and JSON rewriting.</a></li>
<li><a href="/?p=83489876">Expand" implementation and view model mapping.</a></li>
<li><a href="/?p=83489900">Generating API documentation.</a></li>
<li><a href="/?p=83489915">OData, TQL and Filtering.</a></li>
<li><a href="/?p=83489964">Authentication - Session, Basic and OAuth.</a></li>
<li><a href="/?p=83489922">Long running tasks.</a></li>
<li><a href="/?p=83489985">WebAPI Testing.</a></li>
<li><a href="/?p=83489992">Anatomy of an API plugin.</a></li>
<li><a href="/?p=83490005">Final Thoughts.</a></li><br />
</ol></p>
<p><a href="/?p=83489868">Click here to take a look at part 1 - Links, absolute URL's and JSON rewriting</a> - where I cover the process we went through to generate our JSON responses including links and transforming relative URL to absolute URI's as part of the request.</p>
