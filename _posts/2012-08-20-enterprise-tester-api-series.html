<h2>Introduction<&#47;h2></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>APIs are exciting. Not because of their tech per se but because they unlock the ability to innovate. It's all about enablement..<&#47;p>&mdash; Ben Kepes (@benkepes) <a href="https:&#47;&#47;twitter.com&#47;benkepes&#47;status&#47;236615926265544704" data-datetime="2012-08-18T00:10:07+00:00">August 18, 2012<&#47;a><&#47;blockquote><br />
<script src="&#47;&#47;platform.twitter.com&#47;widgets.js" charset="utf-8"><&#47;script></p>
<p>As I mentioned in my last post, part of the development for the latest version of Enterprise Tester has included a greatly expanded REST API.</p>
<p>This REST API is implemented using <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.asp.net&#47;web-api">ASP.Net WebAPI<&#47;a>.</p>
<p>The technology Behind the API is not necessarily "exciting" (compared to what the API enables for customers and 3rd party developers) - but demonstrates taking a large and complex application and exposing much of the functionality through the API.</p>
<p>There are plenty of examples of WebAPI usage out there on blogs, but not much information from people implementing larger API's end-to-end, or retro-fitting an API to an existing (brown-fields) application.  </p>
<p>So I thought this was a good opportunity to dive a little deeper into the implementation of the API. </p>
<p>I'm going to break this up into a few posts covering the various aspects of the API implementation:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="&#47;?p=83489868">Links, absolute URI's and JSON rewriting.<&#47;a><&#47;li>
<li><a href="&#47;?p=83489876">Expand" implementation and view model mapping.<&#47;a><&#47;li>

<li><a href="&#47;?p=83489964">Authentication - Session, Basic and OAuth.<&#47;a><&#47;li>
<li><a href="&#47;?p=83489922">Long running tasks.<&#47;a><&#47;li>
<li><a href="&#47;?p=83489985">WebAPI Testing.<&#47;a><&#47;li>

<p><a href="&#47;?p=83489868">Click here to take a look at part 1 - Links, absolute URL's and JSON rewriting<&#47;a> - where I cover the process we went through to generate our JSON responses including links and transforming relative URL to absolute URI's as part of the request.</p>
