    It's certainly a tongue-in-cheek term, not something to slip into your next white paper ;o) I was just wondering what connotations it had ... I'd always thought of it as a neutral/generally positive term... in retrospect perhaps it borders on entirely meaningless.

    Good spotting on the mistake in the post... though you'll get bored quickly if you start analyzing the text of my posts for errors, I'm pretty slack on it (proof reading that is).

    And last of all, contact details - I've stuck them on the side bar, and repeated them below for your convenience:

<p>I came across this &nbsp;<a href="http://service-architecture.blogspot.com/2007/11/automagically.html">blog entry</a> and to me at least, it just seems wrong?</p>
<p>To quote:</p>
<p>"<em>These are two very different uses of the term that I've heard<br>
and both are explicitly not "automatically" in the true sense of<br>
that word. The point of automagically is when its not automatic at<br>
all and either you don't care (case one) or its a lie (case two).<br>
Now if people agree I'll update the wiki entry but I thought I'd<br>
first check what others had seen.</em>"</p>
<p>Perhaps I've been misinterpreting the use of the word, but In&nbsp;development circles I've always taken it to mean a process that&nbsp;does work automatically, as if by magic - potentially with a hint&nbsp;that there is definitely "magic" involved, i.e. perhaps what's<br>
happening automatically is not deterministic or a little dodgy (a&nbsp;hack), or is is in some way cool/extraordinary i.e. table names&nbsp;being pluralized automagically from their associated entity class&nbsp;names in an ORM, which when I first saw it done many years ago&nbsp;was "magic" by comparison to having to specify the pluralized&nbsp;names by hand.</p>
<p>Is this really a negative term suggesting that somethings not&nbsp;automatic at all? Is my whole life a lie? (Don't answer the&nbsp;second one ;o)</p>
