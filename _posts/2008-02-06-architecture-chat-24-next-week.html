  content: Will do - it's certainly been discussed at previous architecture chat's
    a bit, but it'd be interesting to cover it again... there's a certain lack of
    passion / excitement in the community here that seems to be evident elsewhere
    like wellington.

<p>Hi all...&nbsp; So first off, there's no Architecture Chat today -&nbsp;I'm tied up with prior commitments (due to the short week) so it's&nbsp;going to be held Thursday next week -14th of February,&nbsp;apologies&nbsp;to anyone who was going to attend.</p>
<p>As far as possible topics, what about:</p>
<ul>
<li>All the interesting stuff <a href="http://devhawk.net/2008/01/31/Morning+Coffee+141+LangNET+08+Edition.aspx">that came out</a> of <a href="http://langnetsymposium.com/">Lang.Net</a> (or at least was&nbsp;brought to my attention by that symposium)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.liensberger.it/web/blog/?p=208">Cosmos</a>&nbsp;- a cute operating system written in C#.</li>
<li>Charlie Calvert's <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/charlie/archive/2008/01/25/future-focus.aspx">started posting</a> on the future of C# (4.0).</li>
<li><a href="http://www.tcs.hut.fi/Publications/A101.shtml">Jumbala</a> -&nbsp;another interesting step down the MDA road, this time as an<br />
action language for UML state machines... which can actually be&nbsp;compiled.</li></p>
<li><a href="http://www.wintellect.com/cs/blogs/jrobbins/archive/2008/02/06/download-all-the-net-reference-source-code-at-once-with-net-mass-downloader.aspx">.Net Mass Downloader</a> - here's something I was thinking of&nbsp;doing myself, a mass download for all the .Net Framework source&nbsp;code.</li>
<li>Resharper 4 EAP delayed.</li>
<li>Lightspeed 1.2 <a href="http://www.mindscape.co.nz/blog/?p=64">released</a>.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://blog.bluecog.co.nz/archives/2008/02/06/the-rise-of-wpf-vs-winforms/">rise</a> of WPF vs WinFroms.</li>
<li>The Auckland dev community <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/darrylburling/archive/2008/02/05/day-2-tauranga.aspx">are slackers</a> compared to Tauranga.</li>
