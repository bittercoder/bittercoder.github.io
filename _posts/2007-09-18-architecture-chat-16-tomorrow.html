<p>Sooo....</p>
<p>Another <a href="http:&#47;&#47;wiki.bittercoder.com&#47;SylviaParkArchitectureChats.ashx">architecture&nbsp;chat<&#47;a> tomorrow, 11:30am at the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.garrisonpub.co.nz&#47;default.aspx">usual spot<&#47;a>... some&nbsp;possible topics for discussion.</p>
<ul>
<li>Row vs Column database storage, is Column based storage&nbsp;important?<&#47;li>
<li>Dead Skills - What skills are on the way out &#47; way in for&nbsp;Developers, DBA &amp; Architects?<&#47;li>
<li><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.castleproject.org&#47;">Castle Project<&#47;a> RC3&nbsp;will be out shortly, I'll let you know whats going on.<&#47;li>
<li>I've been watching quite a few <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.ted.com&#47;">TED<&#47;a> presentations over the last month or so - and it leads&nbsp;me to wonder, what sources of Inspiration do people tap into&nbsp;for their own Software Creation?<&#47;li>
<li>PLINQ update - <a href="http:&#47;&#47;msdn.microsoft.com&#47;msdnmag&#47;issues&#47;07&#47;10&#47;PLINQ&#47;default.aspx">it's getting closer!<&#47;a><&#47;li>
<li>I thought this was interesting - <a href="http:&#47;&#47;developers.slashdot.org&#47;article.pl?sid=07&#47;08&#47;25&#47;1648253">a new way to detect code theft<&#47;a>, though how many of us in NZ&nbsp;actually fear code theft at the moment?<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
Light on topics, but still there's plenty of things to fuel&nbsp;debate - look forward to seeing you all there.&nbsp; If anyone has&nbsp;anything else they would like to talk about it (or raised for&nbsp;debate, if you can't make it along) then just leave me a comment or&nbsp;flick me an email.</p>
<p>btw - Not sure if <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.base4.net&#47;">Alex James<&#47;a>&nbsp;will be making it along to this one, but if he does, it will&nbsp;certainly be his last before leaving NZ for the U.S of A.</p>
