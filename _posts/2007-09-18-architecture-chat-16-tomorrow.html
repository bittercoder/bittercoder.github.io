<p>Sooo....</p>
<p>Another <a href="http://wiki.bittercoder.com/SylviaParkArchitectureChats.ashx">architecture&nbsp;chat</a> tomorrow, 11:30am at the <a href="http://www.garrisonpub.co.nz/default.aspx">usual spot</a>... some&nbsp;possible topics for discussion.</p>
<ul>
<li>Row vs Column database storage, is Column based storage&nbsp;important?</li>
<li>Dead Skills - What skills are on the way out / way in for&nbsp;Developers, DBA &amp; Architects?</li>
<li><a href="http://www.castleproject.org/">Castle Project</a> RC3&nbsp;will be out shortly, I'll let you know whats going on.</li>
<li>I've been watching quite a few <a href="http://www.ted.com/">TED</a> presentations over the last month or so - and it leads&nbsp;me to wonder, what sources of Inspiration do people tap into&nbsp;for their own Software Creation?</li>
<li>PLINQ update - <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/07/10/PLINQ/default.aspx">it's getting closer!</a></li>
<li>I thought this was interesting - <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/08/25/1648253">a new way to detect code theft</a>, though how many of us in NZ&nbsp;actually fear code theft at the moment?</li><br />
</ul><br />
Light on topics, but still there's plenty of things to fuel&nbsp;debate - look forward to seeing you all there.&nbsp; If anyone has&nbsp;anything else they would like to talk about it (or raised for&nbsp;debate, if you can't make it along) then just leave me a comment or&nbsp;flick me an email.</p>
<p>btw - Not sure if <a href="http://www.base4.net/">Alex James</a>&nbsp;will be making it along to this one, but if he does, it will&nbsp;certainly be his last before leaving NZ for the U.S of A.</p>
