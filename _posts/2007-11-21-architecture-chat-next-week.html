<p>I'm not going to be around Thursday next week to host the&nbsp;architecture chat...</p>
<p>There are a couple of options:</p>
<ul>
<li>The show goes on as usual, and someone else can flick me a&nbsp;brief summary.</li>
<li>We reschedule for another day (Wednesday or Friday)</li>
<li>Have it the following Thursday (December 6)</li><br />
</ul><br />
Let me know what everyones preferences are...</p>
<p>Chez,</p>
<p>- Alex</p>
