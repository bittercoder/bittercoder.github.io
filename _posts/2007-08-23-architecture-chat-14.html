  content: 'Very good summary, Alex. And there''s no embarrassment about small numbers
    attending -- often that opens up greater opportunities for discussion than are
    not possible in larger groups (where I''m not inclined to talk so much, so others
    can have a turn!). '

<p>So yet another architecture chat come and gone, small turnout&nbsp;today, with 5 people I believe.</p>
<p>Had some interesting discussions none the less...</p>
<p>So first off a brief discussion around <strong>implementing <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;OLE_DB">OleDb<&#47;a><&#47;strong> i.e. what's&nbsp;involved in doing it yourself, is it worth it etc.&nbsp; <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.base4.net&#47;">Alex James<&#47;a> much prefers the idea of&nbsp;implementing an ADO.Net provider which is far easier, though&nbsp;obviously OleDB or ODBC provides a bridge to the past and to other&nbsp;technology platforms like php or ruby.</p>
<p>There are some products (such as the ones from <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.odbcsdk.com&#47;products&#47;openaccess&#47;oledb_features.asp">ODBC&nbsp;SDK<&#47;a>) which lets you write your own across a proprietary data&nbsp;source, though I'm not aware of any open source equivalent for&nbsp;assisting with the development of ODBC or Ole DB providers in&nbsp;.Net..??</p>
<p>After that we had a lengthy discussion about <strong>Microsoft Patterns&nbsp;&amp; Practices<&#47;strong>, partly sparked by the first release of the&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.codeplex.com&#47;RepositoryFactory&#47;">Repository&nbsp;factory<&#47;a> which seems like a bit of a non-event ... the&nbsp;discussion basically resolved around points such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do they have some inbuilt desire to over-engineer these&nbsp;products (it definitely seems like it!)<&#47;li>
<li>Is the over-engineering perhaps sparked by a desire to appear&nbsp;"innovative" in the face of existing community projects, i.e.&nbsp;Enterprise Library logging must appear to innovate in the face of&nbsp;existing projects like log4net of nlogr, which already do what&nbsp;most developers need.<&#47;li>
<li>Are the features in the factories and libraries being driven&nbsp;by customer needs, or some high level vision that doesn't&nbsp;necessarily tie in directly with the pain developers are&nbsp;feeling?<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
I think the gut feeling of the group was that there's a&nbsp;definite lack of pragmatism or YAGNI in a lot of what's released&nbsp;from P&amp;P which is putting people off diving any deeper, it's a&nbsp;shame considering the group as a whole won quite a lot of us over&nbsp;in the early days with the first release of the DAAB.</p>
<p>Moving from that we talked about the <strong>OpenXML<&#47;strong> debate...&nbsp;personally I thought the strong push from Microsoft came a little&nbsp;out of left field during Code Camp (<em>much like the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.mindscape.co.nz&#47;">Mindscape<&#47;a> presentation on<&#47;em>&nbsp;<a style="font-style: italic;" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.mindscape.co.nz&#47;products&#47;LightSpeed&#47;">Lightspeed<&#47;a>&nbsp;;o) - considering I hadn't heard much about it until then in the&nbsp;Microsoft community, and then we bashed around some thoughts, such&nbsp;as impacts of the standard being approved or not - and the&nbsp;motivations of people supporting either standard.&nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp;think most of us aren't particularly concerned with the outcome&nbsp;because our projects don't normally encroach on the document&nbsp;generation &#47; parsing &nbsp;space - though I can certainly see it&nbsp;eventually having quite an impact on regional and local government&nbsp;for instance.</p>
<p>From their we talked about being entirely underwhelmed with&nbsp;<strong>vista sidebar gadgets<&#47;strong>, and the fact that the sand boxed&nbsp;environment of the gadget detracts largely from it's appeal of&nbsp;providing "context" related information for the application your&nbsp;focus is currently on at the time.&nbsp; Obviously work-arounds&nbsp;exist, but I think we were hoping for a more formal&nbsp;publish-subscribe system attached to vista gadgets so information&nbsp;could be easily ferried between applications and vista gadgets in&nbsp;an unobtrusive and more formalized manor.</p>
<p>The <strong><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.maxthon.com&#47;">Maxthon<&#47;a> browser&nbsp;<&#47;strong>came up in conversation, PeterB mentioned using it a few weeks ago,&nbsp;and it looks like he's got at least one convert - in particular it&nbsp;seems that it gets around some of the annoying Internet explorer&nbsp;crashes on vista64, while still using the IE rendering engine&nbsp;etc.... I may well have to give it a go to fix Renee's Vista64&nbsp;PC.</p>
<p>Also had a discussion around using <strong>Windows Workflow&nbsp;Foundation<&#47;strong>, both myself and David W are starting to delve into&nbsp;it for upcoming projects, and we're both finding if difficult&nbsp;to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find decent examples that don't target old beta's.<&#47;li>
<li>Searching only non-beta documentation.<&#47;li>
<li>Find examples which are sufficiently complex enough i.e.&nbsp;where's a "meaty" state engine example, rather then a toy.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
Which also led onto the discussion around examples and&nbsp;blogging - we think products, like Windows workflow, really need&nbsp;some blogging community liaison that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blog's almost if not every day (small nuggets of valuable&nbsp;content, that will make for good search-engine fodder)<&#47;li>
<li>Releases a sample, say once a week up until the product is&nbsp;released, and then with follow up examples for a couple of months&nbsp;at least after release.<&#47;li>
<li>Maintains samples that are released on community sites as new&nbsp;CTP's and the all important RTM's are released, so they don't go&nbsp;stale over time.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
Perhaps we've both overlooked some key resources - but it just&nbsp;seems like the content surrounding windows workflow foundation,&nbsp;particularly on sites like <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.netfx3.com&#47;">netfx3<&#47;a> are actively maintained until&nbsp;the products go final at which point, things such as samples are&nbsp;left targeting previous beta's and serving to confuse the community&nbsp;in many cases.</p>
<p>Next one is in 2 weeks, Thursday 6th September, we might even have&nbsp;a quick 15 minute <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.screwturn.eu&#47;">screwturn<&#47;a>&nbsp;plug-in development demo then... if Peter's in the mood.</p>
