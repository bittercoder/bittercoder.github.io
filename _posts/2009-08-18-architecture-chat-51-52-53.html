  content: Rob - Nothing particularly astounding - just that those of us who had dabbled,
    liked it.  But that nobody was using it in anger, about half the group hadn't
    heard of it, so I think a few more might be going to take a look at it shortly.

<li>New Zealand most peaceful country.</li>
<li>Study identified software developers as generally being&nbsp;healthier then people working in other industries.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.eclipse.org/mylyn/">Mylyn Eclipse&nbsp;Plugin</a>.</li>

<li>Discussed Distributed source control, including..</li>
<li style="list-style: none; display: inline;">
<ul>

<li><a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/">Mecurial</a></li>
<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/gitsharp/">GitSharp</a>&nbsp;(and it's current status)</li>
<li><a href="http://svk.bestpractical.com/view/HomePage%20">SVK</a> -&nbsp;Josh is using it, but hardly anyone else knew of it's&nbsp;existence.&nbsp; Here's the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SVK">wikipedia article</a>&nbsp;for it.</li><br>
</ul><br>
</li>
<li>Peter and Josh put out the call to arms - if you haven't&nbsp;tried a DVCS, now is the time!</li>
<li>Java in legacy lockdown - we discussed the rate of change /&nbsp;addition of new features in Java vs. C# as flagship languages for&nbsp;their associated JVM &amp; CLR.</li>
<li style="list-style: none; display: inline;">
<ul>
<li>Also discussed the current trend (At least on blogs /&nbsp;podcasts) to identify a Java v.Next, such as Scala.</li>
<li>Are java's days really numbered when being considered for&nbsp;developing green-fields apps (as a language, obviously not as&nbsp;a platform).</li><br>
</ul><br>
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.codeplex.com/AutoMapper">Automapper</a> -&nbsp;Updated group of experiences after using it in a recent&nbsp;project, generally nothing but good news to report.&nbsp; Did&nbsp;discuss configuring mappings when using an IoC container or&nbsp;plugin model.</li>
<li>Discussed <a href="http://labs.mozilla.com/projects/weave/">Firefox weave</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.eventmanager.aspx">WPF Event Manager</a> - we discussed why events in WPF are&nbsp;potentially quite slow.</li>
<li style="list-style: none; display: inline;">
<ul>
<li>Discussed the contrast between the winforms event model&nbsp;and WPF.</li>
<li>Also discussed how the windows forms event model was&nbsp;generally inefficient, and sometimes like sucking on a fire&nbsp;hose, relying on efficient handling to avoid issues.</li>
<li>Discussed how the Reactive / <a href="http://themechanicalbride.blogspot.com/2009/04/rx-framework-asynchronous-programming.html"> Rx Framework</a> might help to simplify some of the&nbsp;problems we face today.</li>
<li>Discussed the Drop of the Rx (Linq To Events) In&nbsp;Silverlight 3 - see here for a <a href="http://themechanicalbride.blogspot.com/2009/07/introducing-rx-linq-to-events.html"> great write up</a>.</li><br>
</ul><br>
</li>
<li>Discussed the interesting timing of Lightspeeds announcement&nbsp;of SQL Function support and EF 4.0's ;o)</li>
<li>Discussed open source projects</li>
<li style="list-style: none; display: inline;">
<ul>
<li>The statement "if I don't know about your project, that's&nbsp;your problem" - Amen, open source is not just about throwing&nbsp;code up on a public accessible repository.</li>
<li>Discussed community.</li>
<li>Discussed educational materials, having up to date&nbsp;examples etc.</li>
<li>Discussed the interesting mix of the hugely greatful and&nbsp;downright rude people you interact when running an open&nbsp;source project.</li>
<li>Distinguishing the scratch an itch i.e. casual open&nbsp;source project (normally written by just one person) verses&nbsp;the more organised attempts to create lasting pieces of&nbsp;software and community.</li><br>
</ul><br>
</li>
<li>Discussed <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/">Google Pub Sub</a>.</li>
<li>Peter raised the question of writing services that render&nbsp;directly to the client i.e. using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_Desktop_Protocol">RDP</a> or&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Network_Computing">VNC</a> protocols - talked around if this was a good idea, the&nbsp;feeling that it was a little like x-windows 15+ years ago and&nbsp;that there are some devices or applications that might already&nbsp;be doing this using the VNC protocol (?).</li>
<li>Discussed Internationalization &amp; user customisation,&nbsp;including:</li>
<li style="list-style: none; display: inline;">
<ul>
<li>Implementing the functionality to allow users to create&nbsp;custom "languages" for products so they can change labels,&nbsp;terminology etc.</li>
<li>The costs of doing this at the start of a project vs.&nbsp;after shipping.</li>
<li>The impacts of certain languages on layout.</li>
<li>Why are our web dev frameworks not built with a degree of&nbsp;customisation out of the box i.e. moving the order of fields&nbsp;on screen, changing widths etc.</li><br>
</ul><br>
</li>
<li>Big vs2008 patch? (Not sure what this was, think Peter&nbsp;mentioned it being rolled out about a month ago).</li>
<li>Entity Framework 4.0 features etc.</li>
<li>Talked about the problem of too much content being delivered&nbsp;as video, including:</li>
<li style="list-style: none; display: inline;">
<ul>
<li>Not having the time to actually sit down and watch it -&nbsp;we need more transcripts and audio-only podcasts/content!</li>
<li>Main culprit was identified as Microsoft with <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/">Channel 9</a> &amp; <a href="http://visitmix.com/">Mix</a>, love the content - but there&nbsp;need's to be more pure Audio and transcripts.&nbsp; Round the&nbsp;table most people had hours and hours of videos on their&nbsp;"must watch list" with more and more piling up every day.</li>
<li>Peter raised the question "what are you missing out on by&nbsp;not watching them" - none of use could really answer, gut&nbsp;feeling was probably not much if you keep an eye on twitter&nbsp;and blogs anyway.&nbsp; Also it seems "big picture" stuff is&nbsp;often easy to grok when in video format (or at least more&nbsp;engaging), but video is too slow for anything else.</li><br>
</ul><br>
</li>
<li>Talked about Fibre round NZ - the ongoing "suck" that is&nbsp;Auckland's internet situation, and discussed what's involved what&nbsp;would be involved in setting up a wifi network for smaller NZ&nbsp;towns, to provide high speed access to fibre.</li>
<li>Talked about NHibernate's codebase, why it is the way it is,&nbsp;and the advantages it brings i.e. ability to incorporate&nbsp;associated projects like shards, search etc.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.istartedsomething.com/20090228/microsoft-office-labs-vision-2019-video/">Microsoft futures video</a> - discussed the video, it's&nbsp;"vision" of the future, and contrasted it to videos of the&nbsp;future from 10 years ago, how much was right, how much wasn't&nbsp;etc.</li>
<li>Discussed the <a href="https://hudson.dev.java.net/">Hudson&nbsp;CI Server</a>, and why a few of us like it More the CC.Net and&nbsp;Teamcity.</li>
<li><a href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/overview.html">GWT</a> ..&nbsp;also mentioned some of the interesting bits in <a href="http://raibledesigns.com/rd/entry/how_to_use_gwt_2">GWT 2</a>.</li>
<li>Discussed <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> vs.&nbsp;<a href="http://monodevelop.com/">Mono Develop</a>.&nbsp; Was&nbsp;interesting how divided it was, some people really don't like&nbsp;Eclipse, others quite like it.&nbsp; Also discussed the FUD&nbsp;around Eclipse vs. Mono Develop features.&nbsp; Quite a few of us&nbsp;are using Eclipse for something i.e. PHP or Java development.</li>
<li>We asked the question of "why?" <a href="http://telerikaspnetmvc.codeplex.com/">Teleriks ASP.Net MVC&nbsp;Controls</a> even exist.</li>
<li>Discussed learning <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/">Groovy</a> / <a href="http://grails.org/">Grails</a>, and my dabbling with Groovy as a&nbsp;replacement for <a href="http://commons.apache.org/jelly/">Jelly&nbsp;script</a> in a project I was working on (though I think I&nbsp;mistakenly called it Jettyscript at the time - what a java noob I&nbsp;am! ;o)</li>
<li>Discussed <a href="http://susestudio.com/">Suse Studio</a>&nbsp;and Matt Richards <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMAsk4Fqwb8&amp;feature=related">Mass customisation</a> etc. concepts - and how this could be&nbsp;applied to delivering custom applications.</li>
<li><a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/nick/polyphony/">Polyphonic C#</a> was discussed - including the <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/nick/polyphony/intro.htm">concept of Chords</a> - there was some debate around whether&nbsp;this project became part of <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/nick/polyphony/">c-omega</a> as well (according to the web page, it did).</li>
<li>Discussed Parallelization, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_Extensions">PLinq</a> etc.</li>
<li>We discussed Rob Howard's "legacy" of the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms972319.aspx">provider&nbsp;model</a>, how it came about, <a href="http://telligent.com/">community server</a>, and why for many of&nbsp;us the provider model was either an underwhelming or unsuitable&nbsp;set of extension points.</li>
<li>We talked about Horn, Josh mentioned my "<a href="http://blog.bittercoder.com/PermaLink,guid,5614d98a-98f7-4343-b66c-3bf6da0707e0.aspx">Love&nbsp;letter to Horn</a>" ;o) - and I talked a little about why I think&nbsp;this is important</li>
<li>David started a discussion around Peer to Peer Banking,&nbsp;including this <a href="http://www.jasonkolb.com/weblog/2009/07/building-a-robust-p2p-debt-system.html">interesting article from Jason Kolb</a>.</li>
<li>Discussed if Shards exists for NHibernate.&nbsp; Yes and no&nbsp;from the looks of it, it's in&nbsp;<a href="https://nhcontrib.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/nhcontrib/trunk/src/NHibernate.Shards/">Contrib</a>, but appears to be incomplete / non-functional.</li>
<li>Discussed <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/caliburn">Caliburn&nbsp;WPF framework</a>, and it's yield goodness.</li>
<li>Discussed codeplex making their <a href="http://wikiplex.codeplex.com/">Wiki engine available</a>.</li>
<li>Talked about writing DSL's - including Boo, Oslo's M, and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/mps/">Jetbrains MPS</a>.<br>
Contrasted differences, and why Boo can be quite appealing to&nbsp;developers compared to developing complex grammars for External&nbsp;DSL's.</li><br>
</ul><br>
There were lots more discussions, but I'm finding the&nbsp;conversations too interesting lately so I'm not taking as many&nbsp;notes as I should - If anyone recalls any other discussions /&nbsp;topics, just leave a comment on this post and I'll update it with&nbsp;the relevant details.
<p>See you all next week!</p>
