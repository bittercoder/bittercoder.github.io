  content: Rob - Nothing particularly astounding - just that those of us who had dabbled,
    liked it.  But that nobody was using it in anger, about half the group hadn't
    heard of it, so I think a few more might be going to take a look at it shortly.

<li>Are java's days really numbered when being considered for&nbsp;developing green-fields apps (as a language, obviously not as&nbsp;a platform).<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
<&#47;li></p>
<li><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.codeplex.com&#47;AutoMapper">Automapper<&#47;a> -&nbsp;Updated group of experiences after using it in a recent&nbsp;project, generally nothing but good news to report.&nbsp; Did&nbsp;discuss configuring mappings when using an IoC container or&nbsp;plugin model.<&#47;li>
<li>Discussed <a href="http:&#47;&#47;labs.mozilla.com&#47;projects&#47;weave&#47;">Firefox weave<&#47;a>.<&#47;li>
<li><a href="http:&#47;&#47;msdn.microsoft.com&#47;en-us&#47;library&#47;system.windows.eventmanager.aspx">WPF Event Manager<&#47;a> - we discussed why events in WPF are&nbsp;potentially quite slow.<&#47;li>
<li style="list-style: none; display: inline;">
<ul>
<li>Discussed the contrast between the winforms event model&nbsp;and WPF.<&#47;li>
<li>Also discussed how the windows forms event model was&nbsp;generally inefficient, and sometimes like sucking on a fire&nbsp;hose, relying on efficient handling to avoid issues.<&#47;li>
<li>Discussed how the Reactive &#47; <a href="http:&#47;&#47;themechanicalbride.blogspot.com&#47;2009&#47;04&#47;rx-framework-asynchronous-programming.html"> Rx Framework<&#47;a> might help to simplify some of the&nbsp;problems we face today.<&#47;li>
<li>Discussed the Drop of the Rx (Linq To Events) In&nbsp;Silverlight 3 - see here for a <a href="http:&#47;&#47;themechanicalbride.blogspot.com&#47;2009&#47;07&#47;introducing-rx-linq-to-events.html"> great write up<&#47;a>.<&#47;li><br />

<&#47;li></p>
<li>Discussed the interesting timing of Lightspeeds announcement&nbsp;of SQL Function support and EF 4.0's ;o)<&#47;li>
<li>Discussed open source projects<&#47;li>
<li style="list-style: none; display: inline;">
<ul>
<li>The statement "if I don't know about your project, that's&nbsp;your problem" - Amen, open source is not just about throwing&nbsp;code up on a public accessible repository.<&#47;li>
<li>Discussed community.<&#47;li>
<li>Discussed educational materials, having up to date&nbsp;examples etc.<&#47;li>
<li>Discussed the interesting mix of the hugely greatful and&nbsp;downright rude people you interact when running an open&nbsp;source project.<&#47;li>
<li>Distinguishing the scratch an itch i.e. casual open&nbsp;source project (normally written by just one person) verses&nbsp;the more organised attempts to create lasting pieces of&nbsp;software and community.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
<&#47;li></p>
<li>Discussed <a href="http:&#47;&#47;code.google.com&#47;p&#47;pubsubhubbub&#47;">Google Pub Sub<&#47;a>.<&#47;li>
<li>Peter raised the question of writing services that render&nbsp;directly to the client i.e. using <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Remote_Desktop_Protocol">RDP<&#47;a> or&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Virtual_Network_Computing">VNC<&#47;a> protocols - talked around if this was a good idea, the&nbsp;feeling that it was a little like x-windows 15+ years ago and&nbsp;that there are some devices or applications that might already&nbsp;be doing this using the VNC protocol (?).<&#47;li>
<li>Discussed Internationalization &amp; user customisation,&nbsp;including:<&#47;li>
<li style="list-style: none; display: inline;">
<ul>
<li>Implementing the functionality to allow users to create&nbsp;custom "languages" for products so they can change labels,&nbsp;terminology etc.<&#47;li>
<li>The costs of doing this at the start of a project vs.&nbsp;after shipping.<&#47;li>
<li>The impacts of certain languages on layout.<&#47;li>
<li>Why are our web dev frameworks not built with a degree of&nbsp;customisation out of the box i.e. moving the order of fields&nbsp;on screen, changing widths etc.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
<&#47;li></p>
<li>Big vs2008 patch? (Not sure what this was, think Peter&nbsp;mentioned it being rolled out about a month ago).<&#47;li>
<li>Entity Framework 4.0 features etc.<&#47;li>
<li>Talked about the problem of too much content being delivered&nbsp;as video, including:<&#47;li>
<li style="list-style: none; display: inline;">
<ul>
<li>Not having the time to actually sit down and watch it -&nbsp;we need more transcripts and audio-only podcasts&#47;content!<&#47;li>
<li>Main culprit was identified as Microsoft with <a href="http:&#47;&#47;channel9.msdn.com&#47;">Channel 9<&#47;a> &amp; <a href="http:&#47;&#47;visitmix.com&#47;">Mix<&#47;a>, love the content - but there&nbsp;need's to be more pure Audio and transcripts.&nbsp; Round the&nbsp;table most people had hours and hours of videos on their&nbsp;"must watch list" with more and more piling up every day.<&#47;li>
<li>Peter raised the question "what are you missing out on by&nbsp;not watching them" - none of use could really answer, gut&nbsp;feeling was probably not much if you keep an eye on twitter&nbsp;and blogs anyway.&nbsp; Also it seems "big picture" stuff is&nbsp;often easy to grok when in video format (or at least more&nbsp;engaging), but video is too slow for anything else.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
<&#47;li></p>
<li>Talked about Fibre round NZ - the ongoing "suck" that is&nbsp;Auckland's internet situation, and discussed what's involved what&nbsp;would be involved in setting up a wifi network for smaller NZ&nbsp;towns, to provide high speed access to fibre.<&#47;li>
<li>Talked about NHibernate's codebase, why it is the way it is,&nbsp;and the advantages it brings i.e. ability to incorporate&nbsp;associated projects like shards, search etc.<&#47;li>
<li><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.istartedsomething.com&#47;20090228&#47;microsoft-office-labs-vision-2019-video&#47;">Microsoft futures video<&#47;a> - discussed the video, it's&nbsp;"vision" of the future, and contrasted it to videos of the&nbsp;future from 10 years ago, how much was right, how much wasn't&nbsp;etc.<&#47;li>
<li>Discussed the <a href="https:&#47;&#47;hudson.dev.java.net&#47;">Hudson&nbsp;CI Server<&#47;a>, and why a few of us like it More the CC.Net and&nbsp;Teamcity.<&#47;li>
<li><a href="http:&#47;&#47;code.google.com&#47;webtoolkit&#47;overview.html">GWT<&#47;a> ..&nbsp;also mentioned some of the interesting bits in <a href="http:&#47;&#47;raibledesigns.com&#47;rd&#47;entry&#47;how_to_use_gwt_2">GWT 2<&#47;a>.<&#47;li>
<li>Discussed <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.eclipse.org&#47;">Eclipse<&#47;a> vs.&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;monodevelop.com&#47;">Mono Develop<&#47;a>.&nbsp; Was&nbsp;interesting how divided it was, some people really don't like&nbsp;Eclipse, others quite like it.&nbsp; Also discussed the FUD&nbsp;around Eclipse vs. Mono Develop features.&nbsp; Quite a few of us&nbsp;are using Eclipse for something i.e. PHP or Java development.<&#47;li>
<li>We asked the question of "why?" <a href="http:&#47;&#47;telerikaspnetmvc.codeplex.com&#47;">Teleriks ASP.Net MVC&nbsp;Controls<&#47;a> even exist.<&#47;li>
<li>Discussed learning <a href="http:&#47;&#47;groovy.codehaus.org&#47;">Groovy<&#47;a> &#47; <a href="http:&#47;&#47;grails.org&#47;">Grails<&#47;a>, and my dabbling with Groovy as a&nbsp;replacement for <a href="http:&#47;&#47;commons.apache.org&#47;jelly&#47;">Jelly&nbsp;script<&#47;a> in a project I was working on (though I think I&nbsp;mistakenly called it Jettyscript at the time - what a java noob I&nbsp;am! ;o)<&#47;li>
<li>Discussed <a href="http:&#47;&#47;susestudio.com&#47;">Suse Studio<&#47;a>&nbsp;and Matt Richards <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.youtube.com&#47;watch?v=wMAsk4Fqwb8&amp;feature=related">Mass customisation<&#47;a> etc. concepts - and how this could be&nbsp;applied to delivering custom applications.<&#47;li>
<li><a href="http:&#47;&#47;research.microsoft.com&#47;en-us&#47;um&#47;people&#47;nick&#47;polyphony&#47;">Polyphonic C#<&#47;a> was discussed - including the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;research.microsoft.com&#47;en-us&#47;um&#47;people&#47;nick&#47;polyphony&#47;intro.htm">concept of Chords<&#47;a> - there was some debate around whether&nbsp;this project became part of <a href="http:&#47;&#47;research.microsoft.com&#47;en-us&#47;um&#47;people&#47;nick&#47;polyphony&#47;">c-omega<&#47;a> as well (according to the web page, it did).<&#47;li>
<li>Discussed Parallelization, <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Parallel_Extensions">PLinq<&#47;a> etc.<&#47;li>
<li>We discussed Rob Howard's "legacy" of the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;msdn.microsoft.com&#47;en-us&#47;library&#47;ms972319.aspx">provider&nbsp;model<&#47;a>, how it came about, <a href="http:&#47;&#47;telligent.com&#47;">community server<&#47;a>, and why for many of&nbsp;us the provider model was either an underwhelming or unsuitable&nbsp;set of extension points.<&#47;li>
<li>We talked about Horn, Josh mentioned my "<a href="http:&#47;&#47;blog.bittercoder.com&#47;PermaLink,guid,5614d98a-98f7-4343-b66c-3bf6da0707e0.aspx">Love&nbsp;letter to Horn<&#47;a>" ;o) - and I talked a little about why I think&nbsp;this is important<&#47;li>
<li>David started a discussion around Peer to Peer Banking,&nbsp;including this <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.jasonkolb.com&#47;weblog&#47;2009&#47;07&#47;building-a-robust-p2p-debt-system.html">interesting article from Jason Kolb<&#47;a>.<&#47;li>
<li>Discussed if Shards exists for NHibernate.&nbsp; Yes and no&nbsp;from the looks of it, it's in&nbsp;<a href="https:&#47;&#47;nhcontrib.svn.sourceforge.net&#47;svnroot&#47;nhcontrib&#47;trunk&#47;src&#47;NHibernate.Shards&#47;">Contrib<&#47;a>, but appears to be incomplete &#47; non-functional.<&#47;li>
<li>Discussed <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.codeplex.com&#47;caliburn">Caliburn&nbsp;WPF framework<&#47;a>, and it's yield goodness.<&#47;li>

<li>Talked about writing DSL's - including Boo, Oslo's M, and&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.jetbrains.com&#47;mps&#47;">Jetbrains MPS<&#47;a>.<br />
Contrasted differences, and why Boo can be quite appealing to&nbsp;developers compared to developing complex grammars for External&nbsp;DSL's.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
There were lots more discussions, but I'm finding the&nbsp;conversations too interesting lately so I'm not taking as many&nbsp;notes as I should - If anyone recalls any other discussions &#47;&nbsp;topics, just leave a comment on this post and I'll update it with&nbsp;the relevant details.</p>
<p>See you all next week!</p>
