<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>Well I'm back from Muang Noi Neua (read a later post for info&nbsp;about that) - and I've had my first case of dodgy stomach... so&nbsp;at the moment I'm taking it easy in Luang Prabang (again) till I&nbsp;feel better... so today I thought I'd take the time to stick a&nbsp;few pictures up on my blog for you all to have a looksie at... so&nbsp;here goes:</p>
<p><strong>China!</strong></p>
<p><img title="3 Gorges with snow" src="http://blog.bittercoder.com/content/binary/3_gorges.jpg" alt="3 gorges with snow" width="640" height="480" /></p>
<p>Above, the 3 gorges as seen from the back of the domestic&nbsp;"cruise" ship I was on - it was freezing as it had snowed that&nbsp;morning.</p>
<p><img title="The 3 gorges dam project" src="http://blog.bittercoder.com/content/binary/3_gorges_dam.jpg" alt="3 Gorges dam project" height="480" /></p>
<p>The 3 gorges dam project - a huge piece of work, it still wasn't&nbsp;complete when I was there.</p>
<p><img title="Russian " src="http://blog.bittercoder.com/content/binary/3_gorges_meteor.jpg" alt="3 gorges, russian " height="480" /></p>
<p>The ultimate crusing experience in the 3 gorges, the soviet built&nbsp;(or so I was told) Meteor - you see a few of these round the&nbsp;Chinese waterways - noisey feckers.</p>
<p><img title="Mist covered Karsts in Yanshou" src="http://blog.bittercoder.com/content/binary/yangshou_karsts.jpg" alt="Mist covered Karsts in Yanshou" height="480" /></p>
<p>The mist covered Karts of Yanshou, though not a good picture (it&nbsp;was raining all the time) &nbsp;the scenery is very dramatic.</p>
<p><img title="Night time in Shanghai" src="http://blog.bittercoder.com/content/binary/shanghai_nights.jpg" alt="Night time in Shanghai" height="480" /></p>
<p>Night time in Shanghai, very vegas.</p>
<p><img title="A group shot in China" src="http://blog.bittercoder.com/content/binary/china_group.jpg" alt="A group shot in China" height="480" /></p>
<p>A group shot in China (Putuoshan Island I think) - from left to&nbsp;right we have: Colin from NZ ('tron), Myself, Charlotte (UK),&nbsp;Jarrad (NZ, Wellington), Ed, Scarlet, Desmond (all UK), Christy&nbsp;&amp; Anthony (Australia) and also Tony Chen our amazing Chinese&nbsp;guide</p>
<p><img title="Monk on a cellphone" src="http://blog.bittercoder.com/content/binary/monk_on_cellphone.jpg" alt="Monk on a cellphone" height="640" /></p>
<p>It's funny - I had some weird proconceptions about monks in&nbsp;China, like they wouldn't use technology, wouldn't secretely have&nbsp;girlfriends and aren't prone to mood swings, grumpiness or fits&nbsp;of being irrational... silly me.</p>
<p><img title="Xi'an Centre" src="http://blog.bittercoder.com/content/binary/xian_centre.jpg" alt="Xi'an Centre" height="480" /></p>
<p>The centre of Xi'an - a very cool (and well preserved)&nbsp;city&nbsp;west of Beijing.</p>
<p><img title="Courtyard" src="http://blog.bittercoder.com/content/binary/courtyard_near_xian.jpg" alt="Courtyard" height="480" /></p>
<p>The "courtyard" near Xian, a cool but desolate spot.</p>
<p><img title="Hanging Monestary # 1" src="http://blog.bittercoder.com/content/binary/hanging_monestary_frozen.jpg" alt="Hanging Monestary # 1" height="480" /></p>
<p><img title="Hanging Monestary # 2" src="http://blog.bittercoder.com/content/binary/hanging_monestary.jpg" alt="Hanging Monestary # 2" height="480" /></p>
<p>The above two shots are of the hanging monestary and just to the&nbsp;left of the monestary the frozen stream - which gives you an idea&nbsp;of what the temperature was like then -&nbsp; did end up climbing&nbsp;over the whole of the monestary - I'm not sure it was&nbsp;particularly safe... heh</p>
<p><img title="Great Wall" src="http://blog.bittercoder.com/content/binary/great_wall.jpg" alt="Great Wall" height="480" /></p>
<p>A shot from the great wall, it's um... great</p>
<p><img src="http://blog.bittercoder.com/content/binary/great_wall_track.jpg" /></p>
<p>One of the people we were travelling with (Sally) looked quite ill when I hung over the edge like this ;o) the water down below is where you have to walk from to get up to the wall, it's a bit of a haul.. get your fatty developer sweat on.</p>
<p><img title="Summer Palace, Beijing" src="http://blog.bittercoder.com/content/binary/summer_palace_beijing.jpg" alt="Summer Palace, Beijing" height="480" /></p>
<p>I actually was in a T-Shirt by the time I got to Beijing, this was a really nice 20 degree day at the Summer Palace.</p>
<p><img title="No tossing!" src="http://blog.bittercoder.com/content/binary/no_tossing.jpg" alt="No tossing!" height="225" /></p>
<p>And last of all, I could've spent gigabytes collecting chinglish signs - but you very quickly reach saturation, however I did like this one that was on the Xi'an wall..&nbsp; I wasn't sure if it was forbidding the carnal pleasures of madamme palm and her five lovely daughters, or merely suggesting that jumping off the wall was a bad idea? *shrug*</p>
