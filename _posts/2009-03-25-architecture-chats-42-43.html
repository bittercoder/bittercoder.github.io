<p style="text-decoration: underline;">Architecture Chat #42<&#47;p><br />
Quite a good turn out, fairly rambling - we talked about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rolling your own caching, approaches, what's currently&nbsp;offered by EF and the pitfalls etc. of attempting to substitute&nbsp;database caching with action caching&#47;memoization or partial view&nbsp;caching.<&#47;li>
<li>General discussions on financial situation, current&nbsp;challenges for people running development shops etc.<&#47;li>
<li>Scaling applications, and affects of coding for a&nbsp;non-relational backing data store.<&#47;li>
<li>Continuous integration, Jamie mentioned the interesting&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;timothyfitz.wordpress.com&#47;2009&#47;02&#47;10&#47;continuous-deployment-at-imvu-doing-the-impossible-fifty-times-a-day&#47;">Continuous Deployment at IMVU: Doing the impossible fifty times<br />
a day<&#47;a>.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul></p>

Small turn out - 3 people, Peter B &amp; Tim Barnet (from&nbsp;Hamilton) &amp; Myself.</p>
<p>Most of the discussion was around the .net community in New&nbsp;Zealand, we talked all things community related in NZ- mailing&nbsp;list (including the hamster), what's going on in the user groups,&nbsp;what could be done better, wiki's, collaboration etc.&nbsp; Also&nbsp;contrasted NZ's community with what's happening elsewhere in the&nbsp;world, the current decline of regional mailing list interest&nbsp;compared to growth of <a href="http:&#47;&#47;stackoverflow.com&#47;">stackoverflow<&#47;a> and other more&nbsp;internationally focused development communities.</p>
<p>Also discussed the recent alt.net conference, some of the&nbsp;outcomes, the challenges of really getting mainstream developers&nbsp;interested and the difficulties developers have in getting&nbsp;productive in the .Net community verses others such as php,&nbsp;python or ROR.</p>
<p>Also briefly discussed the lack of a package management solution&nbsp;for .Net developers to make managing interdependencies etc.&nbsp;easier.</p>
