<p><strong>Phnom Penh</strong></p>
<p>Well, lets see... where did I leave off.. ahh yes, having lunch&nbsp;in Phnom Penh on the 12th.. right so, after&nbsp;lunch&nbsp;I&nbsp;bought some books - namely "No Logo", which&nbsp;I've been meaning to read since I read the "fences and windows"&nbsp;also by Naomi Klein, "Ancestral Vices" by Tom Sharpe and finally&nbsp;the "Curious incident of the dog in the night time" by Mark&nbsp;Haddon.</p>
<p>So I headed back to my guesthouse and layed around reading the&nbsp;"Curious incident of the dog in the night time" - which is a very&nbsp;quick read, depressingly so, as I finished it later that same&nbsp;afternoon.. but I really liked the book - most good, and made for&nbsp;a nice break away from the reality of Cambodian street life that&nbsp;gets me down after a couple of hours.</p>
<p>At any rate, I was feeling antisocial that evening and decided to&nbsp;go find some dinner for myself at the quietest restuarant I could&nbsp;locate... found an indian joint that looked well abandoned and&nbsp;decided it was the ticket.. but after sitting down, ordering my<br />
meal and reading my book while consuming an Angkor beer (which is&nbsp;shite, in fact I dont like any of the beers in south east&nbsp;Asia..&nbsp;god I miss dark beer!) a mad kenyan woman sat at my table and&nbsp;just started talking to me... other then her name being Anna I<br />
really didn't understand much of what she was saying.. apparently&nbsp;she was married, but was seeing a friend of a friend who she'd&nbsp;told everything yet never met and that africans open there hearts&nbsp;to other africans yet white people are always suspicious (at this<br />
point I mumbled "and with good reason you mad wench" but she&nbsp;continued merrily on with her monologue) and eventually moved&nbsp;onto talking about someone named Lee Vuthy who she thought worked&nbsp;for the Cambodian daily.&nbsp; It was all complete nonsense and<br />
once my meal was finished I escaped. Incidentally the Cambodian daily seems to be the only English&nbsp;language paper here... and it has a great couple of pages called&nbsp;the 'police blotter' which lists all the major crimes for the&nbsp;last few days... talk about depressing, but I digress.</p>
<p><strong>Off to Siem Reap</strong></p>
<p>The next day I checked out and grabbed the bus up to Siem Reap...&nbsp;this was a thrilling trip, especially the stop in&nbsp;a town I&nbsp;think was called Stung sen, where there were so many street kids&nbsp;begging for food ... it really does your head in when your eating&nbsp;a packet of chips and kids are pulling at your shirt to have&nbsp;some, I cant even equate this to the greed exuded by most of the&nbsp;older street kids here (who only ever want cash) - it really does&nbsp;suck, and the local Cambodian adults&nbsp;are largely&nbsp;desensitized to it - in fact I guess they would have to be - but&nbsp;it does my head in.</p>
<p>At any rate, I met a girl named "sky" from the states who&nbsp;suggested a guesthouse to stay at (the garden village) - which is&nbsp;reasonably central and stocked with loads of boys, like every&nbsp;other guesthouse, who just wander around like they're A.D.D -&nbsp;fiddling and fidgeting, because other then the little bit of&nbsp;driving work they do, they have absoloutely zero stimulus. &nbsp;Personally though I find most of the boys to be generally&nbsp;dishonest, full of shit (sob stories that don't line up with&nbsp;everyone elses sob stories) and greedy (average income is $20 US&nbsp;a month here, yet I would estimate that most of these boys earn&nbsp;that in a week or so) ... some people discribe tourism in&nbsp;Cambodia as a gold rush, and I think that's quite accurate -&nbsp;things will no doubt change over time, but at the moment it&nbsp;definitely seems a bit cheeky and ruthless.</p>
<p>So I grabbed one of the boys, "we", as a driver for Angkor wat&nbsp;and headed out to catch sun down from the hill... which was good,&nbsp;met a couple up there I'd hung out with in Savanaket in Laos, so&nbsp;that was amusing.. exchanged stories etc.&nbsp; That night I had&nbsp;dinner at the Dead fish tower, which did a really nice thai meal&nbsp;(the&nbsp;restaurant&nbsp;has free live music and crocodiles.. *shrug*)..&nbsp;very tastey - and then headed to bed because I had to get up&nbsp;early (5am!) to catch the sun rise at Angkor wat.</p>
<p><strong>Throwing up on Angkor temples</strong></p>
<p>So I got up that morning (the 14th) and was feeling a bit&nbsp;dodgy... nothing out of the ordinary... and then headed out to&nbsp;Angkor Wat, got some nice pictures... felt a bit more dodgy...&nbsp;had some breakfast... complete loss of appetite... felt even more&nbsp;dodgy... had some water... and then had waves of Nausea and&nbsp;eventually threw up in the middle of the Bayon temples...&nbsp;thankfully nobody saw me do it, as it really does seem a little<br />
disrespectful.. not to mention gross... And after that it was all&nbsp;down hill, I started overheating, couldn't keep water down and so&nbsp;around mid day I decided it was a bust and got my driver to head&nbsp;back to the guest house...</p>
<p>On the way back I stopped off at the chemist and got some&nbsp;electrolytes to help with dehydration, and some antibitoics&nbsp;(Ciprofloxacin, well Neocip-500 which appears to be the same&nbsp;thing) which seems to be doing the trick as I feel a lot better&nbsp;today... hopefully tomorrow everything will be back on form and I&nbsp;can continue my exploration of the Angkor wat temples.. on the&nbsp;down side, it means buying another $20 US ticket :(</p>
<p>Right, time for some lunch - hopefully I can keep it down!</p>
