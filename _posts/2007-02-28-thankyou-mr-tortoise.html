<p>I've been using tortoise SVN for a couple of years now... but I'd&nbsp;never seen this dialog before when renaming files with similar name&nbsp;patterns... probably old news to some people, but it pleased me no&nbsp;end, very helpful!</p>

It's these kinds of features that I like about an explorer based&nbsp;SCM client... I find IDE integrated source control just bugs me&nbsp;now days (like Team System which I use for codeplex).</p>
