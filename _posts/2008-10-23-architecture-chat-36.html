<p>Talked about Venture Capital including Incubators like the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.theicehouse.co.nz&#47;">Ice House<&#47;a> &amp; <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.e-centremassey.org.nz&#47;">E-Centre<&#47;a> ... organisations&nbsp;such as <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.aintog.co.nz&#47;">AintoG<&#47;a> (and a brief&nbsp;comment on how small Auckland is, because everyone at the table had&nbsp;bumped into at least one of the guys from AintoG at some point),&nbsp;the Ice House <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.theicehouse.co.nz&#47;news-award_1.html">pitch&nbsp;competition<&#47;a> and VC climate in NZ and around the world with the&nbsp;current financial situation.</p>
<p>We talked a bit about WPF composability and run time&nbsp;decoration&#47;behaviour extensions (also applies to Web as well) i.e.&nbsp;how do you not only replace or introduce new parts to your&nbsp;application but allow plugin&#47;module&#47;extension developers to adorn&nbsp;and extend existing components of your application (and in such a&nbsp;way to multiple extensions&#47;decorations can be applied to a single&nbsp;component at the same time)... AOP for UI?</p>
<p>Ajax-only applications and the issues involved with unit testing&nbsp;them compared to traditional applications - the pain of regressions&nbsp;when you don't have enough coverage at the integration level and&nbsp;where bugs tend to crop up when you have nothing between your<br />
<body><&#47;body> tags, plus a little disucssion around&nbsp;using 3rd party JS control libraries such as extjs.</p>
<p>The lack of transparency for initiatives like Oslo compared to the&nbsp;other MS projects like MVC, DLR that feel a lot more open.&nbsp; A&nbsp;number of guys were interested in seeing just what "D" looks&#47;smells&nbsp;like though.</p>
<p>How to learn WPF, and useful resources including using Safari Books&nbsp;online (which I'm going to sign up to this month to give it a try,&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;designingcode.blogspot.com&#47;">Keith<&#47;a> raves about&nbsp;it :)</p>
<p>A brief whine about <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.devexpress.com&#47;">DevExpress<&#47;a> components (bad&nbsp;documentation, poor performance of controls such as their winforms&nbsp;tree component etc.) - and how with the advent of WPF it's often&nbsp;easier to develop your own WPF controls in-house rather then&nbsp;purchase the equivalent online, and the discussion around how&nbsp;building complex controls would never have been attempted with&nbsp;WinForms in house due to complexity.</p>
<p>The trend of ASP.Net MVC to look a little more like Monorail with&nbsp;every release.</p>
<p>Routing woes (in both Monorail and ASP.Net MVC) and lack of Area&nbsp;support in ASP.Net MVC.</p>
<p>Preliminary builds i.e. check in, say to a private branch, it's&nbsp;merged with trunk, private branch builds on build server, if it&nbsp;passes then the merged changes are applied to trunk (to avoid&nbsp;developers breaking trunk, and allowing for more frequent&nbsp;check-ins) and various approaches that could be used to prevent or&nbsp;lessen the chance of breaking the trunk build (also known as&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;blogs.msdn.com&#47;bharry&#47;archive&#47;2008&#47;10&#47;14&#47;pre-checkin-validation-for-tfs.aspx">gated check in<&#47;a> in TFS 2010).</p>
<p>SVN vs. GIT - the noticeable increase in GIT take-up and mindshare,&nbsp;the lack of mature gui tools, and how&#47;if you could move BA's and&nbsp;designers over to using a tool like GIT and some thoughts around&nbsp;shelving.</p>
