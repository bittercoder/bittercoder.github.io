<p class="MsoNormal">Well it's over - and it's been great!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">First off Architecture Camp 2007 was a lot of fun to present at&nbsp;this weekend... the relaxed nature and opportunities for everyone&nbsp;to talk, rather than just listening, was great - a nice soft&nbsp;introduction to a newbie presenter such as myself!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">And a big hat-tip to all the guys who helped put this together,&nbsp;including <a href="http://www.base4.net/">Alex James</a>, Kurt&nbsp;(where's your blog boy!) and <a href="http://www.syringe.net.nz/">Chris</a> + all the other&nbsp;presenters.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The thing I liked the most about this event was the number of&nbsp;people who <strong>brought their a-game</strong>... damn but there were&nbsp;some seriously experienced and intelligent guys in the audience,&nbsp;asking great questions - contrasted with the often pointless&nbsp;heckling and misguided questioning you can get at events like&nbsp;teched, this event was great ... if you couldn't make it,&nbsp;definitely try to get to the next architecture camp, and if you&nbsp;were a no-show ... shame on you!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I'm still not 100% sure if my session got recorded or not, but if&nbsp;it did, I'll point you to it at some point... <span>&nbsp;</span>in the mean time - here's the presentation itself&nbsp;in both <a href="http://blog.bittercoder.com/content/binary/IoC-ArchitectureCamp-2007.pdf">pdf</a> and <a href="http://blog.bittercoder.com/content/binary/IoC-ArchitectureCamp-2007-pptx.zip">pptx</a> (powerpoint 2007) formats.</p>
