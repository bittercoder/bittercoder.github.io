<p>It seemed a long time coming, but finally <a href="http://ayende.com/Blog/archive/2007/02/17/Rhino-Mocks-3.0-Beta-Released.aspx"><br>
Rhino Mock's 3.0</a> is available, which of course also means<br>
<a temp_href="http://wiki.castleproject.org/index.php/DynamicProxy"></a><br>
href="http://wiki.castleproject.org/index.php/DynamicProxy%20">Dynamic<br>
Proxy 2 has made it to that sweet generic method support<br>
nirvana as well :)<br><br>
<br><br>
I don't know where I'd be without these tools, I haven't done a<br>
.Net project without them in the last couple of years... in fact<br>
it's fueled my reluctance over the last couple of years for<br>
returning to bespoke development at any NZ dev shop which might<br>
dictate other (crappier) alternatives ;o)<br><br>
<br><br>
I also noticed that mono is getting it's <a href="http://mareksafar.blogspot.com/index.html">C# 3.0 support slowly<br>
sorted</a>... Extension methods are in, as is some Lambda<br>
support... I need to sit down and spend some time thinking about<br>
how I should go about unit testing some of this stuff, it's on my<br>
list of "testing" things to do right after getting to grips with<br>
RhinoMocks 3 and perhaps writing another blog entry on mocking<br>
Base4 with all the new "goodies" - I need to do a monorail/base4<br>
website for another little venture, so it's probably as good a time<br>
as any.<br><br>
<br><br>
Went for a swim at Omaha today... just can't get enough of the<br>
beach this year - <a href="http://campbelllive.tv3.co.nz/">John<br>
Campbell</a> turned up at the same time we did, there's only so<br>
many "Not in front of John" jokes I can handle in one day... or a<br>
life time ;o)<br></p>
