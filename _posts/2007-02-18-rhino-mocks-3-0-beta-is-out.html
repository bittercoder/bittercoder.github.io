<p>It seemed a long time coming, but finally <a href="http:&#47;&#47;ayende.com&#47;Blog&#47;archive&#47;2007&#47;02&#47;17&#47;Rhino-Mocks-3.0-Beta-Released.aspx"><br />
Rhino Mock's 3.0<&#47;a> is available, which of course also means<br />
<a temp_href="http:&#47;&#47;wiki.castleproject.org&#47;index.php&#47;DynamicProxy"<br />
href="http:&#47;&#47;wiki.castleproject.org&#47;index.php&#47;DynamicProxy%20">Dynamic<br />
Proxy 2<&#47;a> has made it to that sweet generic method support<br />
nirvana as well :)<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
I don't know where I'd be without these tools, I haven't done a<br />
.Net project without them in the last couple of years... in fact<br />
it's fueled my reluctance over the last couple of years for<br />
returning to bespoke development at any NZ dev shop which might<br />
dictate other (crappier) alternatives ;o)<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
I also noticed that mono is getting it's <a href="http:&#47;&#47;mareksafar.blogspot.com&#47;index.html">C# 3.0 support slowly<br />
sorted<&#47;a>... Extension methods are in, as is some Lambda<br />
support... I need to sit down and spend some time thinking about<br />
how I should go about unit testing some of this stuff, it's on my<br />
list of "testing" things to do right after getting to grips with<br />
RhinoMocks 3 and perhaps writing another blog entry on mocking<br />
Base4 with all the new "goodies" - I need to do a monorail&#47;base4<br />
website for another little venture, so it's probably as good a time<br />
as any.<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
Went for a swim at Omaha today... just can't get enough of the<br />
beach this year - <a href="http:&#47;&#47;campbelllive.tv3.co.nz&#47;">John<br />
Campbell<&#47;a> turned up at the same time we did, there's only so<br />
many "Not in front of John" jokes I can handle in one day... or a<br />
life time ;o)<br &#47;></p>
