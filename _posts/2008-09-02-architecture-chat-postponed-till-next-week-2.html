<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>I'm afraid I'm going to have to postpone the Architecture chat&nbsp;until next week, due to other commitments on Thursday.</p>
<p>So it's now rescheduled for next Thursday - 11<sup>th&nbsp;</sup>September - if anyone has any topics, or saw anything cool at code&nbsp;camp or teched this week then leave a comment on this post and I'll&nbsp;add to the list of topics for next week.</p>
