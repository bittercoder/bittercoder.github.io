<p><span style="font-size: small;">The Sylvia Park Architecture chat was today, bit slow to start with, but not a bad turn out with 9 of us in the end.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">First some stats:</span></p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><span style="font-size: small;">Number of people presenting at teched</span></td></p>
<td><span style="font-size: small;">1 (Alex James)</span></td><br />
</tr></p>
<tr>
<td><span style="font-size: small;">Number of people going to teched</span></td></p>
<td><span style="font-size: small;">3</span></td><br />
</tr></p>
<tr>
<td><span style="font-size: small;">Number of people going to codecamp</span></td></p>
<td><span style="font-size: small;"> 7'ish</span></td><br />
</tr><br />
</tbody><br />
</table><br />
<span style="font-size: small;">First off I asked the question, should you open source software that is key to your business, sparked by a recent conversation with and old business partner who's been considering open sourcing the product I helped develop for him - mostly because the business makes money for deploying/consulting/configuring the software more so then licensing it, and the remote chance of other people using/promoting etc. the product couldn't hurt the companies profile.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">This sparked a bit of a debate, and certainly a few of the people developing products in the group had some opinions.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: small;">It's not a matter of make the source available and they will come, you need to actively construct a community around your product.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: small;">You need to make all the communications for the project visible.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: small;"> If you cannot communicate the vision for your product clearly, you'll never get traction with the community.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: small;">By and large you&rsquo;re better off focusing on making money, there's a long lead time before OSS projects gain traction.</span></li><br />
</ul><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">We then moved onto something a little more hands-on, talking a bit about <a href="http://blog.bittercoder.com/ct.ashx?id=e306bf46-2a4f-4f0e-92d5-4c729584d7ce&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.ayende.com%2fBlog%2fcategory%2f545.aspx">Rhino ETL</a> - I ran through my experience so far (</span><span style="font-size: small;">personally </span><span style="font-size: small;">I'm liking it a lot) and the feedback from others was that <a href="http://blog.bittercoder.com/ct.ashx?id=e306bf46-2a4f-4f0e-92d5-4c729584d7ce&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fmsdn2.microsoft.com%2fen-us%2flibrary%2fms141026.aspx">SSIS</a> does about 98% of what you need, with the customization work required for the other 2% taking as long as the rest of the project!&nbsp; I could see RhinoETL being a great little swiss army knife for a lot of data-related projects in the future, especially with its target support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Keith's question was asked, when is PeterB going to start blogging/bliki'ing... not any time soon I believe was the response, as he requires some kind of alter-ego... Along the same lines we also briefly talked about the decline in blogging, and what &ldquo;good&rdquo; blogs people read among all the noise that's out there today...&nbsp; Technology-savy VC's came up in the conversation, such as <a href="http://blog.bittercoder.com/ct.ashx?id=e306bf46-2a4f-4f0e-92d5-4c729584d7ce&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.paulgraham.com%2f">Paul Graham</a> (of "<a href="http://blog.bittercoder.com/ct.ashx?id=e306bf46-2a4f-4f0e-92d5-4c729584d7ce&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fstore1.yimg.com%2fI%2fpaulgraham_1960_4195185">hackers and painters</a>" fame).<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Tagging &amp; tagging file systems were next on the table (like Alex James's <a href="http://blog.bittercoder.com/ct.ashx?id=e306bf46-2a4f-4f0e-92d5-4c729584d7ce&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.base4.net%2fBlog.aspx%3fTag%3dXTend">XTend</a> which got a mention) and Peter noted that the upcoming service pack for Vista should make it a lot easier to organize data via "piles" i.e. dragging documents without an author over a pile of documents by a certain author will assign the author to the anonymous document.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">The key point/concern was that these kinds of tasks must not make search operations harder i.e. Categorization should never penalize search operations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Talked a little about BDD or <a href="http://blog.bittercoder.com/ct.ashx?id=e306bf46-2a4f-4f0e-92d5-4c729584d7ce&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fbehaviour-driven.org%2f">Behaviour Driven Development</a>, this struck a chord with Peter who has been doing something very similar with existing clients, though I'm not sure I articulated the Analysis side of the BDD very well - there's a nice <a href="http://blog.bittercoder.com/ct.ashx?id=e306bf46-2a4f-4f0e-92d5-4c729584d7ce&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fdannorth.net%2fintroducing-bdd">BDD introductory post</a> on the DanoNorth.net blog.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">In my mind at least BDD is all about ubiquitous language &ndash; I see it as the central tenant of BDD, where energy and thought is put into keeping the business level parts of corporation or company in-line with the development/software/solution parts - tying it all together with a common language/vocabulary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Digging in deeper we have some software frameworks to help with BDD testing:<br />

</span></p>
<p>On a similar note Test Driven Development cropped up, with the interesting question of just how you could "force" or "lead" someone through the process of developing test first (without just having them watch a screen-cast) ... easier said then done I think was the consensus.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Also briefly covered was <a href="http://blog.bittercoder.com/ct.ashx?id=e306bf46-2a4f-4f0e-92d5-4c729584d7ce&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.mindscape.co.nz%2fProducts%2fLightSpeed%2f">Lightspeed 1.0</a> and the announcement of the versions/pricing came up... Some of us were intrigued by the model-based pricing structure :)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Incidentally Like the container tutorials series I did, I also index these blog entries (and some general information about the Sylvia Park chats) on my <a href="http://blog.bittercoder.com/ct.ashx?id=e306bf46-2a4f-4f0e-92d5-4c729584d7ce&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwiki.bittercoder.com%2fSylviaParkArchitectureChats.ashx">wiki</a>.</span></p>
