<p>In the last <a href="http://blog.bittercoder.com/Trackback.aspx?guid=367c1e6a-39c8-4103-8bde-63061b48b1d7">post about WiX shortcuts</a> I detailed how to make an unisntall&nbsp;link... it was actually slightly wrong ;o) ... well at least if&nbsp;your product Id wasn't surrounded with braces... so here's the&nbsp;offending line fixed for product Guid's that aren't surrounded with&nbsp;braces (which is generally what you should be using in a WiX&nbsp;file)</p>
<pre><customaction id="SetUninstallArgs" property="UNINSTALLARGS" value="/x {$(var.PRODUCTGUID)}"></customaction></pre><br>
As you were...
