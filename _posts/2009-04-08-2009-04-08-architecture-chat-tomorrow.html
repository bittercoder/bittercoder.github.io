<p>Architecture chat tomorrow, pretty topic-light this week.. some&nbsp;quick things that have taken my interest recently:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http:&#47;&#47;altnetpodcast.com&#47;episodes&#47;18-talking-with-jeremy-miller-about-alt-net">ALT.Net Podcast featuring Jeremy Miller<&#47;a> - An interesting&nbsp;follow-up after the Scott Bellware discussion last week, and&nbsp;probably more inline with how I see ALT.Net.<&#47;li>
<li>Loads of azure info coming out over the last few weeks.. I&nbsp;think this <a href="http:&#47;&#47;oakleafblog.blogspot.com&#47;2009&#47;04&#47;windows-azure-and-cloud-computing-posts.html">OakLeaf Systems post<&#47;a> sums it up best.<&#47;li>
<li>Mauricio Scheffer has an interesting <a href="http:&#47;&#47;bugsquash.blogspot.com&#47;2009&#47;04&#47;using-windsor-in-f.html">blow-by-blow post<&#47;a> on using Castle Windsor's fluent&nbsp;interface with F# - and the fact that it's... not so&nbsp;fluent.&nbsp; Definitely something to give thought to when&nbsp;crafting fluent interfaces - are there going to be F# or other&nbsp;language clients, and just what is their experience going to be&nbsp;like?<&#47;li>
<li>Interesting <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.codeplex.com&#47;ncommon">ncommon&nbsp;library<&#47;a> - a generic framework for Unit of work, generic&nbsp;Repository<T>, validation and business rules etc. &nbsp;Supports NHibernate, Linq2Sql &amp; EF. See the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;blogger.forgottenskies.com&#47;?p=388">Steve Gentile<&#47;a> post&nbsp;for more details.&nbsp; Though obviously a Repository<T><br />
isn't to everyone's tastes or necessarily a fit with repositories&nbsp;being a business concern.<&#47;li></p>
<li><a href="http:&#47;&#47;blogs.msdn.com&#47;alexj&#47;">Alex James<&#47;a> has been&nbsp;posting a bunch of <a href="http:&#47;&#47;blogs.msdn.com&#47;alexj&#47;archive&#47;tags&#47;Tips&#47;default.aspx">EF&nbsp;tips<&#47;a> (11 so far).<&#47;li>
<li>Got a couple of books from O'Reilly for review &#47; the group&nbsp;library - Let me know if anyone at the chat would like to read&nbsp;them &#47; review them - they are: <a href="http:&#47;&#47;oreilly.com&#47;catalog&#47;9780596522698&#47;">97 Things Every<br />
Software Architect Should Know<&#47;a> and <a href="http:&#47;&#47;oreilly.com&#47;catalog&#47;9780596517984&#47;">Beautiful&nbsp;Architecture<&#47;a>.&nbsp; Or if there any books they'd like the&nbsp;group to get to read&#47;review.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
Also wouldn't mind discussing the Architecture group itself -&nbsp;i.e. Possibility of North shore meet-ups, setting up a dedicated&nbsp;website, what the name of the group should be, handing out swag&nbsp;etc.</p>
<p>Last of all - would be interested to see if anyone made along to&nbsp;the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;preetsangha.blogspot.com&#47;">Beer &amp;&nbsp;Bytes<&#47;a> this week (unfortunately I was stuck in a meeting that&nbsp;evening) - looking at Preet's blog post I suspect a few of you&nbsp;did.</p>
<p>We'll be meeting at the usual time of 11:30am @ Garrisons, Sylvia&nbsp;Park, Tomorrow (Thursday 9th April 2009) - and the topics above&nbsp;are just there in case we run out of anything else to talk about&nbsp;(which is rare).</p>
<p>For more details on the location and write-ups of previous&nbsp;sessions you can consult the associated <a href="http:&#47;&#47;wiki.bittercoder.com&#47;SylviaParkArchitectureChats.ashx">wiki<&#47;a>.</p>
