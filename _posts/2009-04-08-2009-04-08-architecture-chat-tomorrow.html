<p>Architecture chat tomorrow, pretty topic-light this week.. some&nbsp;quick things that have taken my interest recently:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://altnetpodcast.com/episodes/18-talking-with-jeremy-miller-about-alt-net">ALT.Net Podcast featuring Jeremy Miller</a> - An interesting&nbsp;follow-up after the Scott Bellware discussion last week, and&nbsp;probably more inline with how I see ALT.Net.</li>
<li>Loads of azure info coming out over the last few weeks.. I&nbsp;think this <a href="http://oakleafblog.blogspot.com/2009/04/windows-azure-and-cloud-computing-posts.html">OakLeaf Systems post</a> sums it up best.</li>
<li>Mauricio Scheffer has an interesting <a href="http://bugsquash.blogspot.com/2009/04/using-windsor-in-f.html">blow-by-blow post</a> on using Castle Windsor's fluent&nbsp;interface with F# - and the fact that it's... not so&nbsp;fluent.&nbsp; Definitely something to give thought to when&nbsp;crafting fluent interfaces - are there going to be F# or other&nbsp;language clients, and just what is their experience going to be&nbsp;like?</li>
<li>Interesting <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/ncommon">ncommon&nbsp;library</a> - a generic framework for Unit of work, generic&nbsp;Repository<t>, validation and business rules etc. &nbsp;Supports NHibernate, Linq2Sql &amp; EF. See the <a href="http://blogger.forgottenskies.com/?p=388">Steve Gentile</a> post&nbsp;for more details.&nbsp; Though obviously a Repository<t><br>
isn't to everyone's tastes or necessarily a fit with repositories&nbsp;being a business concern.</t></t></li>
<li><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/alexj/">Alex James</a> has been&nbsp;posting a bunch of <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/alexj/archive/tags/Tips/default.aspx">EF&nbsp;tips</a> (11 so far).</li>
<li>Got a couple of books from O'Reilly for review / the group&nbsp;library - Let me know if anyone at the chat would like to read&nbsp;them / review them - they are: <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596522698/">97 Things Every<br>
Software Architect Should Know</a> and <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596517984/">Beautiful&nbsp;Architecture</a>.&nbsp; Or if there any books they'd like the&nbsp;group to get to read/review.</li><br>
</ul><br>
Also wouldn't mind discussing the Architecture group itself -&nbsp;i.e. Possibility of North shore meet-ups, setting up a dedicated&nbsp;website, what the name of the group should be, handing out swag&nbsp;etc.
<p>Last of all - would be interested to see if anyone made along to&nbsp;the <a href="http://preetsangha.blogspot.com/">Beer &amp;&nbsp;Bytes</a> this week (unfortunately I was stuck in a meeting that&nbsp;evening) - looking at Preet's blog post I suspect a few of you&nbsp;did.</p>
<p>We'll be meeting at the usual time of 11:30am @ Garrisons, Sylvia&nbsp;Park, Tomorrow (Thursday 9th April 2009) - and the topics above&nbsp;are just there in case we run out of anything else to talk about&nbsp;(which is rare).</p>
<p>For more details on the location and write-ups of previous&nbsp;sessions you can consult the associated <a href="http://wiki.bittercoder.com/SylviaParkArchitectureChats.ashx">wiki</a>.</p>
