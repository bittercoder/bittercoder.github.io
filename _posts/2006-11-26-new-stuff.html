<h2>Vista<&#47;h2><br />
Well I've been playing with a couple of things this weekend...&nbsp;first off is Vista... it's been on my laptop for a while now, but&nbsp;I haven't really been using it because It's a bit of a drag&nbsp;getting my development environment set up... but I've been&nbsp;working on that tonight, and have my current project being built&nbsp;successfully... so that's cool... the only real problem is my&nbsp;laptop is no longer a laptop since I've installed Vista...</p>
<p>The problem is power... where as I could squeeze upwards of 2 to&nbsp;2.5&nbsp;hours from the battery under xp, in power saving mode&nbsp;with Vista I get an hour if I'm lucky... it says exactly 1 hour&nbsp;of available capacity after boot, every "build all" in Visual&nbsp;Studio reduces that number by about 5 minutes... this is not&nbsp;particularly useful, heading to a cafe to code for&nbsp;an hour&nbsp;or two is looking problematic - At first I thought that perhaps&nbsp;the minimum speed step value wasn't being utilized, but according&nbsp;to the resource monitor it's at "37%" of the maximum frequency,&nbsp;which is ~800mhz, which seems right... So I have no idea why my&nbsp;battery life is so bad.</p>
<p>Second to this, max performance is only workable for&nbsp;about&nbsp;two hours before the machine will freeze - too much&nbsp;heat - not a new problem, certainly this was an issue under xp&nbsp;sp2&nbsp;or win2k3&nbsp;-&nbsp;Incidentally it's an <a href="http:&#47;&#47;h18002.www1.hp.com&#47;products&#47;quickspecs&#47;12140_div&#47;12140_div.HTML">HP NW8240<&#47;a> which scores 4 on the "Vista" performance scale&nbsp;(Pentium M 2.13ghz, 2gig ram, ATI FireGL V5000) and the cooling&nbsp;solution is really not adequate to deal with the heat generated&nbsp;from the processor and GPU at max performance, but it only&nbsp;cropped up while gaming in the past with XP SP2...&nbsp;now this&nbsp;happens while working with Visual Studio 2005 for&nbsp;a couple&nbsp;of hours... I suspect it's probably because I'm using Aero, the&nbsp;laptops definitely hotter then it used to be, I'll switch off&nbsp;Aero tomorrow and see how I fare, problem goes away if I switch&nbsp;to balanced performance mode of course, but without max&nbsp;performance Resharper 2.02&nbsp;is an utter dog.</p>
<p>Other problem I have is getting bluetooth to work, which is a bit&nbsp;of a pain when using my phone as I've lost the mini-SD adaptor so&nbsp;I can't slot it into my monitors card reader... more a&nbsp;minor&nbsp;niggle though, I can live without it for now.</p>
<h2>Supreme Commander<&#47;h2><br />
The other thing I've been playing with this weekend was&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Supreme_Commander">Supreme&nbsp;Commander<&#47;a>&nbsp;beta, spiritual successor to <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Total_Annihilation">Total&nbsp;Annihilation<&#47;a>... TA was the defacto RTS we played while I was&nbsp;at uni,&nbsp;and it also served as the standard by which we&nbsp;measured any future RTS's (and &nbsp;generally found them wanting,&nbsp;especially when it came to an interface for selecting, scheduling&nbsp;and command units)...</p>
<p>SupCom is very faithful to the concepts and feel of TA, and it&nbsp;runs just fine on Vista, but I did end up lowering all the&nbsp;settings, and still suffered from overheating and crashes after&nbsp;half an hour of play on my laptop... *sigh* I need to experiment&nbsp;a little further to see how the dual screen support works, but so&nbsp;far the game looks great, and it provides some wonderful&nbsp;strategic views which make it easier to control masses of units&nbsp;(And I&nbsp;do mean <strong>masses<&#47;strong>, hopefully the&nbsp;multi-threading support is good, I could definitely see this game&nbsp;benefiting from dual-core, or maybe quad-core once an&nbsp;implementation is released which isn't quite so gimped)...&nbsp;looking forward to getting my hands on the finished product when&nbsp;it's released next year.</p>
