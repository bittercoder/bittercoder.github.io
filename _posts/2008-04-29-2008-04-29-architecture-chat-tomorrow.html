    I've let paralell performance and ParalellFX go quiet for a while - we did it to death a bit last year... ;o)

    I heard about robochamps on DotNetRocks, though I haven't had a spare moment to have a play with it just yet... I certainly had a look at the 1.0 Microsoft Robotics Studio a while back and saw some potential there :)

<p>Architecture chat tomorrow, 1st May, 11:30am at Garrisons, Syliva&nbsp;Park.</p>
<p>Last week was a nice general discussion, I wouldn't mind doing&nbsp;something similar again - so I'm pretty topic light at the&nbsp;moment... other then a few general observations from the&nbsp;community.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/livemesh/">LiveMesh</a> - lots&nbsp;of talk about this over the last couple of weeks.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.codeplex.com/xunit/">xUnit</a> 1.0 now&nbsp;available.</li>
<li>New Drop of <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/SpecSharp/">Spec#</a> available.</li>
<li>Migrations frameworks - plenty to choose from now, including&nbsp;<a href="http://code.google.com/p/migratordotnet/wiki/GettingStarted">Migrator.Net</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.rikware.com/RikMigrations.html">RikMigrations</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/jacob.lewallen/archive/2008/04/25/a-first-look-at-machine-migrations.aspx">Machine.Migrations</a> [<a href="http://svn2.assembla.com/svn/machine/trunk/Machine.Migrations/">src</a>]&nbsp;and <a href="http://www.t3rse.com/twining/">Twining</a> (though&nbsp;more of a general toolkit than a migrations framework)...&nbsp;probably missed a few others as well.</li><br>
</ul><br>
If you have any other topic suggestions just leave a comment on&nbsp;this post.
<p>See you all tomorrow!</p>
