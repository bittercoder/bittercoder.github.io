<h2>What is it?<&#47;h2><br />
The "Architecture Chat" is a technology agnostic meetup for Developers, DBA's etc (Though there are more .Net developers then anything else at the meet ups) - with the focus on Discussion, as opposed to presentation. &nbsp;They are held during the daytime, normally at a Cafe or Bar - the number of people attending range between 4 at the low end and 12 or more at the high end. &nbsp;Contrary to the name, discussing Architecture is not what the catch up is all about.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How did it start?<&#47;h2><br />
The Idea for an Architecture Chat was floated by Alex James during the Architecture Camp 2007 event, and organisation of the catch ups shifted to Myself after Alex James joined Microsoft and Moved overseas.</p>
<p>The first meetup was held on the&nbsp;26th of April 2007, and Has been occurring between every 1 and 3 weeks since - over the last couple of years we have settled into a Rhythm of once every 2 weeks, On a Thursday, starting at 11:30am and Finishing up around 1:30 to 2:00pm.</p>
<p>Initially we kept good records of what was discussed at each chat and blogged it - but over time this got a little too demanding and so we stopped numbering&nbsp;the chats after around #50 - which was in 2009, and at an estimate have probably had over 150 meetings since it's inception. As such we are probably one of the more successful community events for Developers in the Auckland Region.</p>
<h2><&#47;h2></p>
<h2>Venues<&#47;h2><br />
Over the years we have had a number of Venues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Columbus Cafe in Ellerslie<&#47;li>
<li>Garrisons Bar in Sylvia Park<&#47;li>
<li>Benediction Cafe in Newton (Current Venue - The Coffee is good, and the Vietnamese Spring Rolls are great)<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
Anyone is welcome, and there is no requirement to book your place - just turn up on the day - drop me a DM on twitter if you are new and worried you won't be able to spot our group - in Benediction you can normally find upstairs outside and the long concrete table.</p>

<h2>How Long<&#47;h2><br />
The Chats are generally on a Thursday, starting at 11:30am and Finishing up at 1:30 - 2:00pm - Obviously some people attending the Chats have work commitments etc. - so if you can turn up at 12:00 and stay till 1:00, no problem. Lunch is normally eaten at some point during the Chat as well (in case your worried about getting Hungry).</p>

<h2>Topic List<&#47;h2><br />
Before every chat we start collecting "topics" - the topics don't dictate the discussion, but it helps to align everyone a little so they have some common things to talk about. Over the years the topics have been collected in lots of different ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Email<&#47;li>
<li>Blog Comments<&#47;li>
<li>Google Wave<&#47;li>
<li>Google Docs (The current way we do it)<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
If you are a regular we will normally invite you to the document, or if you are new, or only come occasionally, I do announce the New Doc each week on twitter (follow @bittercoder and look for the hashtag #ArchitectureChat) - We use google docs because it has low barrier to Entry, and allows for collaborative editing support.</p>
<p>I Want to Come along to the next chat, what should I do?</p>
<p>Drop me an <a href="mailto:bittercoder@gmail.com">email<&#47;a> or DM on twitter (<a href="https:&#47;&#47;twitter.com&#47;bittercoder">@bittercoder<&#47;a>) and I can let you know when the next chat is on, and I'll also make sure we keep an eye out for you - and don't forget to bring along some of your work colleagues as well :)</p>
<h2>Sponsorship<&#47;h2></p>
<p>Every second meetup (once per month) we give away a prize to one of our attendees, prizes are currently donated by Jetbrains - who we are very grateful to have as a sponsor, thanks Jetbrains!<br&#47;></p>
